# Specialized Instructions – Screenshots & Media

Recommended path (if not yet formalized):
docs/images/<nav-group>/<topic>-<state>-step<n>.png

Guidelines:

1. Filenames semantic & lowercase; steps sequential when multiple.
2. Alt text describes function (“Credentials creation form before submission”).
3. Avoid embedding extraneous UI edges—crop to relevant element.
4. If dark-mode contrast questionable, propose a neutral variant or second -dark file.
5. Do not inline base64; always relative path.
6. If multiple views (list vs detail), encode state: agents-list, agents-detail.
7. If user uncertain about directory, ask before finalizing path.
