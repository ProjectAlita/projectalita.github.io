<h1 id="prompts">Prompts</h1>
<h2 id="private-project-prompts-menu">Private project - Prompts menu</h2>
<p>The <strong>Prompts</strong> menu within <strong>Private</strong> project serves as a dedicated inventory for all your prompts, irrespective of their current status. Consider it your personal repository for saving and organizing the prompts you've crafted. </p>
<p><img alt="Prompts-Menu_Detailed_View" src="../../../img/admin-guide/prompts/Prompts-Menu_Detailed_View.png" /></p>
<h3 id="how-to-create-a-new-prompt">How to Create a New Prompt</h3>
<p>In the context of AI and machine learning, a prompt is an instruction, question, or statement that is given to an AI model to elicit a response or output. It serves as the initial input for systems like conversational agents or generative models.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>+ Prompt</strong> button located on the top right of the <strong>Prompts</strong> menu. This action will navigate you to the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, where you can define and set up your new prompt.</li>
<li>Within the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, you will need to fill in the mandatory fields: <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, and <strong>Context</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Provide a clear and concise name for your prompt to easily identify it later.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Add a brief explanation of the prompt's purpose or intended use.</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>:  Enter the foundational information or instructions that will guide the AI model's responses. This is a crucial step in defining the scope and behavior of your prompt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After filling in the required information, click the <strong>Save</strong> button to create your prompt.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields are non-editable after the prompt is saved. Ensure you have entered the correct information before saving. While creating your prompt in the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, you can also configure other settings like <strong>Tags</strong>, <strong>Welcome Message</strong>, <strong>Conversation Starters</strong>, and <strong>Messages</strong> to further customize your prompt's behavior and interaction flow.</p>
<p><img alt="Prompts-Create_New_Prompt" src="../../../img/admin-guide/prompts/Prompts-Create_New_Prompt.png" /></p>
<p>After creating a prompt and saving it, the prompt's interface will be organized into three distinct tabs, each serving a specific purpose in managing and utilizing your prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run tab</strong>: This is your primary interface for executing the prompt. Here, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the prompt's configuration, including any defined variables. If variables are configured, you can input or modify their values before execution. Crucially, this tab also allows you to adjust the settings that govern the AI model's behavior for this specific run, such as selecting the desired Model, and fine-tuning parameters like Temperature, Top-P, Top-K, and Maximum Completion Tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration tab</strong>: This tab is dedicated to the setup and modification of the prompt's core elements. Within this tab, you have the ability to adjust all the fundamental settings of the prompt, including the Context that guides the AI, the Messages that structure the interaction, the optional Welcome Message displayed to users, and any Conversation Starters designed to initiate specific interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring tab</strong>: This tab provides valuable insights into the usage and performance of your prompt. Here, you can access monitoring data related to the prompt's executions, allowing you to track its activity, understand its usage patterns, and potentially identify areas for optimization or refinement. For more information about Monitoring, refer to the <a href="../../settings/#monitoring">Monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changes made within both the <strong>Run</strong> and <strong>Configuration</strong> tabs can be either saved to update the prompt or discarded to revert to the previous state, providing flexibility and control over your prompt configurations.</p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>In ELITEA, <strong>Tags</strong> are a powerful organizational tool that allows you to categorize and manage your collection of prompts, datasources, and agents effectively. Think of them as labels that help you quickly identify and group related items. By assigning relevant tags to each prompt, you create an intuitive labeling system that significantly simplifies access and retrieval. This is particularly beneficial when you have a large number of prompts covering various topics or use cases. You can later filter your prompts by these tags, making it easy to find the precise prompt you need without sifting through an extensive list.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Tags to Your Prompt:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the <strong>Tags</strong> input box within the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Begin typing a <strong>tag name</strong>. As you type, you may see suggestions for pre-existing tags. You can either select one of these suggestions or continue typing to create a new tag.</li>
<li>To finalize a tag, click the <strong>Enter</strong> key. This will add the tag to your prompt.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button to save the prompt with the selected tags.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You have the flexibility to assign one or more tags to each prompt, allowing for a multi-dimensional labeling system. This means a single prompt can be associated with multiple categories, enhancing its discoverability.</p>
<p><img alt="Prompts-Create_a_Tag" src="../../../img/admin-guide/prompts/Prompts-Create_a_Tag.png" /></p>
<h3 id="context">CONTEXT</h3>
<p>The <strong>Context</strong> field in ELITEA is a fundamental component where you provide the essential background information, instructions, and guidelines that direct the LLM in generating accurate and relevant responses. This section acts as the foundational knowledge base for the model, enabling it to understand and effectively process your specific requests. A well-defined context is crucial for achieving the desired output from the AI.</p>
<p><strong>How to Effectively Input Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify Key Information</strong>: Before you start typing, carefully consider the essential details or instructions the model needs to understand your request effectively. This might include the topic, specific terminology, relevant background information, the desired format of the output, or the specific task you want the model to perform.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the Details Clearly and Concisely</strong>:  Input the identified information directly into the <strong>Context</strong> field. Ensure your language is clear, concise, and unambiguous. Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentences. The more direct and focused your context, the better the model can understand and respond appropriately.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Variables for Dynamic Content</strong>: For situations where you need to introduce dynamic elements into your prompts, you can incorporate variables directly within the <strong>Context</strong>. Variables are denoted by double curly braces, for example, <code>{{variable_name}}</code>. Once you define a variable in the <strong>Context</strong>, it will automatically appear in the <strong>Variables</strong> section, where you can assign a specific value to it. This allows you to create reusable prompts that can be easily adapted for different scenarios by simply changing the variable values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For comprehensive guidance on crafting effective instructions for your prompts, please refer to the <a href="../prompts-examples/">Prompting Frameworks</a> document. This resource provides valuable strategies and examples to help you optimize your prompts for better results.</p>
<h4 id="editability-and-version-control">Editability and Version Control</h4>
<p>You can edit the <strong>Context</strong> field at any time to update or refine the instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editing Existing Context</strong>: Simply make changes directly in the Context field and save them. This updates the prompt to reflect the latest information.</li>
<li><strong>Creating New Versions</strong>: If you want to keep the original version, you can save your changes as a new version. This is useful for comparing different versions or keeping a history of changes. <strong>Note</strong>: For more information check the <a href="#managing-prompt-versions-save-create-versions-and-manage">Managing Prompt Versions: Save, Create Versions, and Manage</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features allow you to adapt and improve the instructions as needed, ensuring the responses remain relevant and accurate.</p>
<h3 id="messages">MESSAGES</h3>
<p>The <strong>MESSAGES</strong> section is a powerful feature that allows you to meticulously structure the flow of interaction within a prompt by defining specific roles and content for different participants in the conversation. This section is crucial for creating more complex and nuanced interactions with the LLM model.</p>
<p>The <strong>MESSAGES</strong> utilizes three distinct message types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Message</strong>: This message sets the overall context, instructions, and guidelines for the Gen AI's behavior. It's like providing the AI with its role and responsibilities for the interaction. This message is not visible to the end-user but is fundamental in shaping the AI's responses.</li>
<li><strong>Assistant Message</strong>: This represents the Gen AI's responses or contributions within the conversation. You can pre-define Assistant Messages to guide the interaction or provide examples of the desired output format.</li>
<li><strong>User Message</strong>: This simulates the input or queries from the user interacting with the Gen AI. You can use User Messages to set up specific scenarios or provide examples of how a user might interact with the prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p>These message types work in concert to create a structured and meaningful dialogue. The <strong>System Message</strong> establishes the framework, the <strong>User Message</strong> initiates and guides the conversation flow, and the <strong>Assistant Message</strong> provides the content of the interaction, all contributing to a coherent and purposeful exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Message Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Message</strong>: Think of this as the "director's notes" for the AI. It defines the AI's persona, the task at hand, and any specific rules or constraints it should follow.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>System Message: &quot;You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in providing concise summaries of scientific articles. Focus on extracting the main findings and conclusions.&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assistant Message</strong>: This allows you to pre-program the AI's responses or provide examples of how it should respond to certain user inputs.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>User Message: &quot;What is the main finding of this article?&quot;
Assistant Message: &quot;The main finding of the article is that...&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Message</strong>: This allows you to simulate user input and guide the conversation flow.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>User Message: &quot;Summarize the methodology section.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Managing Messages:</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the interactivity of a prompt, you can add multiple messages of any type by clicking the <strong><code>+</code></strong> icon, selecting the desired message type from the dropdown, and providing the relevant content.</p>
<p>You also have the flexibility to manage the order and content of your messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Remove a message by clicking the delete icon.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong>: Duplicate a message by clicking the copy icon.</li>

<p>By setting up conversation starters, you streamline the process of initiating specific tasks or queries, making your interactions with the prompt more efficient and standardized.</p>
<h3 id="variables">VARIABLES</h3>
<p>The <strong>Variables</strong> within prompts introduce a powerful layer of dynamic customization, allowing you to create flexible and reusable prompts that can be easily adapted to specific needs or contexts without requiring modifications to the core prompt structure. This feature significantly enhances the versatility and efficiency of your prompts.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Variables:</strong></p>
<p>Variables are placeholders within your prompt's <strong>Context</strong> or <strong>Messages</strong> that are denoted by double curly brackets, for example, <code>{{user_story}}</code>. These placeholders represent information that might change depending on the specific use case.</p>
<p><strong>How Variables Work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define Variables in Context or Messages</strong>:  Begin by identifying the elements within your <strong>Context</strong> or <strong>Messages</strong> that you want to make dynamic. Replace these static values with variable placeholders using the <code>{{variable_name}}</code> syntax. Choose descriptive names for your variables to easily understand their purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Population in the Variables Section</strong>: Once you define a variable in the <strong>Context</strong> or <strong>Messages</strong>, it will automatically appear in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section located below.</li>
<li><strong>Assign Values to Variables</strong>: In the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section, you can assign specific values to each defined variable. This is where you provide the actual data that will replace the placeholder when the prompt is executed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process empowers you to create prompts that can be easily adapted by simply changing the values of the variables, eliminating the need to rewrite the entire prompt for different scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You have the flexibility to define one or more variables within each prompt. Variables can be defined in both the <strong>Context</strong> and <strong>Messages</strong> sections, providing flexibility in how you structure your dynamic prompts.</p>
<p><img alt="Prompts-Create_Variables" src="../../../img/admin-guide/prompts/Prompts-Create_Variables.png" /></p>
<h3 id="advanced-settings">ADVANCED SETTINGS</h3>
<p>For users who require more granular control over the AI model's behavior, ELITEA provides <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>. These settings allow you to fine-tune the parameters that influence the generation of responses. To access these settings, click the <strong>Gear</strong> icon on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab or <strong>SETTINGS</strong> section under the <strong>Run</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The following advanced settings are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: This dropdown menu allows you to select the specific Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to process your prompt. Different models have varying capabilities and performance characteristics. Common options include:<ul>
<li><code>gpt-4o</code>: A highly capable and advanced model known for its nuanced understanding and high-quality output.</li>
<li><code>gpt-35-turbo</code>: A more cost-effective and faster model that still provides excellent performance for a wide range of tasks.
The choice of model can significantly impact the quality, speed, and cost of your prompt executions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: This parameter controls the randomness and creativity of the AI's responses. It is a value between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.<ul>
<li>A <strong>lower temperature</strong> (closer to 0) results in more predictable and focused responses. The AI will tend to choose the most likely next words, making the output more deterministic and consistent. This is suitable for tasks requiring factual accuracy and precision.</li>
<li>A <strong>higher temperature</strong> (closer to 1 or above) introduces more randomness, leading to more creative and unexpected outputs. The AI will consider less probable words, potentially generating more diverse and novel responses. This is useful for brainstorming, creative writing, or when exploring different possibilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Top P (0-1)</strong>: Also known as nucleus sampling, <strong>Top P</strong> offers another way to control the randomness of the output. It works by considering the smallest set of most probable tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the value of P.<ul>
<li>A <strong>lower Top P</strong> value (e.g., 0.1) means the AI will only consider a very small, highly probable set of tokens, leading to more focused and deterministic responses.</li>
<li>A <strong>higher Top P</strong> value (e.g., 0.9) allows the AI to consider a broader range of tokens, including less probable ones, resulting in more varied and potentially creative outputs.
<strong>Top P</strong> provides a more dynamic way to control randomness compared to <strong>Temperature</strong>, as the number of tokens considered can vary depending on the context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Top K</strong>: This parameter limits the AI's token selection to the <strong>K</strong> most likely tokens at each step of the generation process.<ul>
<li>A <strong>lower Top K</strong> value (e.g., 10) restricts the AI to choosing from only the top 10 most probable tokens, leading to more focused and predictable responses.</li>
<li>A <strong>higher Top K</strong> value (e.g., 100) allows the AI to choose from a wider range of likely tokens, potentially increasing the diversity and surprise in the output.
<strong>Top K</strong> is useful for controlling the vocabulary and ensuring the AI stays within a certain range of likely words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Completion Tokens</strong>: This setting defines the maximum length of the AI's generated response, measured in tokens. Tokens can be roughly thought of as parts of words.<ul>
<li>Setting a <strong>lower value</strong> for <strong>Maximum Completion Tokens</strong> will result in shorter, more concise responses. This is useful when you need brief answers or summaries.</li>
<li>Setting a <strong>higher value</strong> allows the AI to generate longer, more detailed responses. Be mindful that longer responses may consume more processing resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully adjusting these <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, you can tailor the AI's behavior to suit the specific requirements of your prompt and achieve the desired output characteristics. Experimenting with these parameters can significantly enhance the effectiveness and versatility of your interactions with ELITEA.</p>
