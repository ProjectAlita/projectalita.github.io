<p><img alt="Intro-Settings_Monitoring(Part1)" src="../../img/admin-guide/intro/Intro-Settings_Monitoring%28Part1%29.png" /></p>
<h3 id="adoption-and-usage">Adoption and Usage</h3>
<p>Below the key metrics, you'll find the <strong>Adoption and Usage</strong> section, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Users</strong>: A bar chart displaying the number of active users over time.</li>
<li><strong>Token Usage</strong>: A line chart showing the tokens consumed (In) and generated (Out) over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These charts provide insights into user engagement and the application's token economy.</p>
<h3 id="acceptance-rate">Acceptance Rate</h3>
<p>The <strong>Acceptance Rate</strong> section provides a comprehensive view of user interactions with the ELITEA application, focusing on how often users accept the generated outputs. This section includes visualizations that help you understand user satisfaction and the effectiveness of the system's responses.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance Rate Chart</strong></p>
<p>The Acceptance Rate Chart displays the number of accepted and not accepted interactions for the selected period and filter options. This chart helps you assess how frequently users find the generated outputs useful enough to accept by copying, downloading, or saving them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accepted Interactions</strong>: This metric shows the count of interactions where user(s) have accepted the generated output, indicating satisfaction and utility.</li>
<li><strong>Not Accepted Interactions</strong>: This metric reflects the number of interactions where user(s) did not accept the output, suggesting areas for potential improvement in response quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>By analyzing the Acceptance Rate Chart, you can gain insights into user satisfaction levels and identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of the ELITEA application, ultimately improving the overall user experience.</p>
<h3 id="sentiments">Sentiments</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sentiments</strong> section provides a visual representation of the emotional tone of both user inputs and the outputs generated by LLMs. Understanding sentiment is crucial for tailoring responses to better meet user needs and improve overall interaction quality.</p>
<h4 id="sentiment-analysis-overview">Sentiment Analysis Overview</h4>
<p>Sentiment analysis categorizes text into three primary emotional states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive</strong>: Indicates a favorable or happy emotional tone.</li>
<li><strong>Negative</strong>: Indicates an unfavorable or unhappy emotional tone.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral</strong>: Indicates a neutral or indifferent emotional tone.</li>
</ul>
<p>ELITEA performs sentiment analysis on user inputs to gauge the user's emotional state. This capability is particularly important for providing high-quality customer service, as the LLM can adjust its response tone and content based on the user's emotions.</p>

<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3>
<p>The <strong>Accuracy</strong> section provides detailed insights into the performance and reliability of the ELITEA application. This section includes various metrics and visualizations that help you understand how well the system is responding to user inputs and how effective your configured artifacts (prompts, datasources, agents, conversations) are.</p>
<h4 id="relevance">Relevance</h4>
<p>The <strong>Relevance</strong> metric is divided into two key lines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input vs Context</strong>: This line measures the relevance of the user's input (question or query) against the context of the artifact (prompt, datasource, agent or conversation). In the ELITEA, "context" refers to the configured instructions for the artifact. A higher relevance score indicates that the user's input closely matches the context, making it easier for the LLM to provide accurate responses.</li>
<li><strong>Output vs Input</strong>: This line measures the relevance of the generated output by the LLM against the user's input. A higher relevance score here indicates that the output is closely aligned with the user's query, ensuring that the response is appropriate and useful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The maximum value for relevance is 6. The higher the score, the better the relevance, indicating a more accurate and contextually appropriate interaction.</p>
<h4 id="reliability">Reliability</h4>
<p>The <strong>Reliability Score</strong> answers the question of whether there is enough context to respond accurately to the user's questions or queries. This metric helps you gauge the confidence level of the LLM's responses. <strong>Note</strong>: The maximum reliability score is 10. A higher score indicates that there is sufficient context to provide a correct and reliable response to the user's query.</p>
<h4 id="instruction-quality-vs-usage">Instruction Quality vs Usage</h4>
<p>The <strong>Instruction Quality vs Usage</strong> is a 2x2 matrix that helps you evaluate the effectiveness and utilization of your artifacts (prompts, agents, datasources or conversations):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Quality, Low Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have low quality scores and are rarely used. These artifacts may need to be re-evaluated or improved.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, Low Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have high quality scores but are not frequently used. Efforts should be made to promote these high-quality artifacts to increase their usage.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, High Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have high quality scores and are frequently used. These are your most effective artifacts and should be maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Low Quality, High Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have low quality scores but are frequently used. These artifacts should be improved in quality or their usage should be reduced in favor of higher-quality alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matrix legend</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Score</strong>: The maximum quality score is 4. A higher score indicates better quality.</li>
<li><strong>Calls</strong>: This metric shows how many times an artifact has been used. Depending on the context (matrix box), a higher number of calls can be either positive or negative.</li>
