<h2 id="the-publication-process-sharing-your-expertise">The Publication Process: Sharing Your Expertise</h2>
<p>The Public Project thrives on community contributions. If you have created valuable Prompts or Collections in your <strong>Private</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> projects, you are encouraged to share them with the wider ELITEA community by publishing them to the Public Project.</p>
<h3 id="publishing-prompts-to-the-public-project">Publishing Prompts to the Public Project</h3>
<p>To share your best Prompts with the community:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create and Refine Prompt in Private/Team Project:</strong> Develop and thoroughly test your Prompt in your <strong>Private Workspace</strong> or a <strong>Team Project</strong>. Ensure it is well-documented, high-quality, and provides valuable functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Initiate Publication:</strong> Open the <strong>Prompts</strong> menu in your <strong>Private</strong> project, locate the Prompt you want to share, and click the <strong>"Publish"</strong> icon associated with that Prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Version Naming:</strong> In the "Publish version" pop-up window, provide a descriptive <strong>Version Name</strong> for your Prompt (e.g., "Version 1.0 - Initial Release," "Version 1.1 - Improved Accuracy"). Click <strong>"Publish"</strong> to submit the Prompt for moderation.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation Review:</strong> Your submitted Prompt will undergo a review process by ELITEA moderators. Moderators will assess the Prompt for quality, relevance, clarity, and adherence to community guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Approval and Publication:</strong> If your Prompt meets the moderation criteria, it will be <strong>Approved</strong> and published to the <strong>Prompts menu within the Public Project</strong>, making it accessible to all ELITEA users. You will receive a notification regarding the outcome of the moderation process.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Notes on Prompt Publication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality and Relevance:</strong> Only high-quality, well-documented, and relevant Prompts are typically approved for publication to maintain the value and integrity of the Public Project resource pool.</li>
<li><strong>Moderator Feedback:</strong> If your Prompt is <strong>Rejected</strong> during moderation, you will receive constructive feedback from the moderators, explaining the reasons for rejection and providing guidance on how to improve your Prompt for potential future submission.</li>
<li><strong>Version Control:</strong> When publishing, you are publishing a specific <strong>version</strong> of your Prompt. This allows you to continue developing and improving your Prompts in your <strong>Private</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> projects without affecting the published version in the Public Project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="publishing-collections-to-the-public-project">Publishing Collections to the Public Project</h3>
<p>To share curated sets of related Prompts (and potentially other Entities in the future) with the community:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create and Curate Collection in Private/Team Project:</strong> Create a well-organized and valuable Collection in your <strong>Private Workspace</strong> or a <strong>Team Project</strong>. Ensure it contains a set of thematically related and high-quality Entities (at least one published Prompt is required currently).</li>
<li><strong>Initiate Collection Publication:</strong> Open the <strong>Collections</strong> menu in your <strong>Private</strong> project, locate the Collection you want to share, and click the <strong>"Publish collection" icon</strong> within the Collection Detail View.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation Review:</strong> Your submitted Collection will undergo a review process by ELITEA moderators, similar to the Prompt publication process. Moderators will assess the Collection for relevance, organization, and overall value to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Approval and Publication:</strong> If your Collection meets the moderation criteria and contains at least one published Prompt, it will be <strong>Approved</strong> and published to the <strong>Collections menu within the Public Project</strong>, making it discoverable and accessible to all ELITEA users. You will be notified of the moderation outcome.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Notes on Collection Publication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Requirement - Published Entity:</strong> A Collection must contain at least one <em>already published</em> Entity (currently, at least one published Prompt) to be eligible for publication.</li>
<li><strong>Separate Entity Publication:</strong> Publishing a Collection does <em>not</em> automatically publish the individual Entities contained within it. Ensure that all Prompts (and other Entities you intend to share publicly within the Collection) are published <em>separately</em> before publishing the Collection.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Duplication:</strong> Publishing a Collection creates a <em>duplicate</em> of your Collection in the Public Project. Changes made to your original Collection after publishing will not automatically update the published version.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Prompts (Currently):</strong> Currently, Collection publishing primarily focuses on sharing groups of Prompts. While Collections can contain Datasources and Agents, the publishing mechanism is primarily designed for sharing Prompts within Collections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-of-published-entities-leveraging-community-resources">Usage of Published Entities: Leveraging Community Resources</h2>
