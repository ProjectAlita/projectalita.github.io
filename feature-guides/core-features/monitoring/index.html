<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Monitoring feature in ELITEA presents a variety of metrics and charts to help you understand different aspects of application usage and performance. This section provides a detailed breakdown of each currently available metric, explaining its purpose, how it is calculated, the formula used, and practical examples to illustrate its interpretation and utilization. Understanding these metrics is key to effectively monitoring ELITEA's adoption, user engagement, and the effectiveness of your AI-powered workflows.</p>
<h3 id="in-scope-metrics">In-Scope Metrics</h3>
<p>Currently, ELITEA Monitoring focuses on two key metrics that provide valuable insights into user interaction and workflow success: <strong>Engagement Rate</strong> and <strong>Acceptance Rate</strong>. These metrics are designed to be actionable, helping you identify areas for improvement and measure the impact of your optimization efforts.</p>
<h4 id="engagement-rate-measuring-user-activity">Engagement Rate: Measuring User Activity</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Engagement Rate</strong> metric is a vital indicator of user adoption and active participation within ELITEA. It quantifies the percentage of users with the designated "<strong>Monitor</strong>" role who are actively interacting with ELITEA projects during a specific time period.  A higher <strong>Engagement Rate</strong> suggests broader adoption and more consistent utilization of ELITEA within your team.</p>
<p><strong>Formula: Unpacking the Calculation</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Engagement Rate = (Number of Active Users with “Monitor” role) / (Total Number of Users with “Monitor” role) * 100%
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break down the components of this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numerator: Number of Active Users with “Monitor” role:</strong> This represents the count of <em>unique</em> individuals who have been assigned the "Monitor" role in ELITEA and have demonstrated active engagement during the chosen time frame.  "Active engagement" is defined by specific actions (see "Definition of 'Active User'" below).</li>
<li><strong>Denominator: Total Number of Users with “Monitor” role:</strong> This is the total count of all users who have been granted the "Monitor" role within the selected Project or Portfolio. This represents the total potential user base for ELITEA monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplication by 100%:</strong>  The result of the division is multiplied by 100 to express the Engagement Rate as a percentage, making it easier to interpret and compare.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculation Period:</strong> The Engagement Rate is calculated for the specific time period defined by the <strong>"From" and "To" dates</strong> that you select in the Filtering Panel. This allows you to analyze engagement over different durations, such as weekly, monthly, or custom date ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Key Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculated per Project or Group:</strong>  Engagement Rate is not a global metric. It is calculated and displayed <em>separately</em> for each Project or Group that you select in the "Projects" filter. This allows you to compare engagement levels across different teams or areas of your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of "Active User":</strong>  To be counted as an "active user" for the Engagement Rate metric, a user with the "<strong>Monitor</strong>" role must have performed at least <em>one</em> of the following actions within the selected timeframe:<ul>
<li><strong>Engaged in a Conversation (New or Existing) and Interacted with an ELITEA Entity:</strong> This action encompasses both initiating new chat sessions and actively participating in existing ones, demonstrating ongoing engagement with ELITEA's core functionalities. To be considered "active" through conversation engagement, the user must have:<ul>
<li><strong>Created a new conversation within the Chat interface, OR interacted with an <em>existing</em> conversation.</strong>  This means either starting a fresh chat or continuing an ongoing dialogue in a previously created chat.</li>
<li><strong>Interacted within that conversation (whether new or existing) with at least one of the following ELITEA entities:</strong> an LLM model directly, a Prompt, a Datasource, or an Agent.  Simply viewing a conversation or having it open without actively sending messages to or receiving responses from an ELITEA entity does not qualify as "active" usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Directly Executed an ELITEA Entity:</strong> This action signifies a user directly invoking and utilizing ELITEA's core functionalities outside of a standard chat conversation flow. To be considered "active" through this action, the user must have:<ul>
<li><strong>Executed (run or triggered) at least one of the following ELITEA entities:</strong> a Prompt, a Datasource, or an Agent.  This includes direct executions initiated through any part of the ELITEA interface, not solely within chat conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Utilize Engagement Rate for Actionable Insights:</strong></p>
<p>The User Engagement Rate is not just a number; it's a powerful diagnostic tool to understand ELITEA adoption and guide improvement efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify Low Engagement as a Trigger for Action:</strong> A consistently low Engagement Rate (e.g., consistently below 50%, or below your expected target) should serve as a trigger for investigation and action. It suggests that a significant portion of users with the "<strong>Monitor</strong>" role are not actively using ELITEA, indicating a potential gap between the intended and actual utilization of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnose Potential Causes of Low Engagement:</strong>  A low Engagement Rate prompts you to investigate <em>why</em> users are not engaging. Consider these potential reasons:<ul>
<li><strong>Insufficient User Training and Onboarding:</strong> Users may be unaware of ELITEA's capabilities, unsure how to use it effectively, or lack the necessary skills to leverage its Use Cases.<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Implement or enhance user training programs. Provide hands-on workshops, create easily accessible user guides and tutorials, offer personalized onboarding support, and establish channels for users to ask questions and receive guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Use Case Relevance to User Needs:</strong> The currently available Use Cases within ELITEA might not be directly relevant or valuable to the daily tasks and workflows of the intended users. If users don't find the Use Cases helpful for their actual work, they are less likely to engage.<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong>  Actively solicit user feedback on the relevance and usefulness of existing Use Cases. Conduct user interviews, surveys, or feedback sessions to understand their specific needs and pain points. Based on this feedback, fine-tune existing Use Cases to better align with user workflows, or prioritize the development of new Use Cases that address unmet needs and provide more tangible value to users' daily activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Effective Engagement Rate Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establish a Regular Review Cadence:</strong>  Make reviewing the Engagement Rate a recurring activity. <strong>Weekly reviews are highly recommended</strong> to track trends and identify any sudden drops or consistently low engagement levels.</li>
<li><strong>Set Weekly Reporting Timeframes:</strong>  For consistent weekly tracking, always use the "From" and "To" date filters to define the reporting period as the <strong>past week (e.g., Monday to Sunday of the previous week)</strong>. This ensures that you capture a complete week's worth of usage data, accounting for variations in weekday vs. weekend activity and potential offshore team usage patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider "Project Alpha" and analyze its Engagement Rate for the past week (Monday to Sunday):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total users with "<strong>Monitor</strong>" role in "Project Alpha": <strong>50</strong></li>
<li>Number of users in "Project Alpha" who were "active" (created chats or used workflows) during the past week: 20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement Rate Calculation:</strong> (20 Active Users / 50 Total Users) * 100% = <strong>40%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> An Engagement Rate of 40% for "Project Alpha" suggests that a significant majority (60%) of users with the "Monitor" role are <em>not</em> actively engaging with ELITEA within this project. This low rate warrants further investigation. You should explore potential reasons for this low engagement, such as lack of training, irrelevant Use Cases, or technical barriers, and implement appropriate resolutions to improve user adoption and utilization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="acceptance-rate-gauging-use-case-and-entity-effectiveness">Acceptance Rate: Gauging Use Case and Entity Effectiveness</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Acceptance Rate</strong> metric provides crucial insights into the perceived value and successful utilization of ELITEA's AI-powered capabilities, <strong>extending beyond just Use Cases to encompass the effectiveness of individual Prompts, Datasources, and Agents.</strong> It quantifies the percentage of times users take a defined "acceptance action" after interacting with ELITEA, indicating they found the generated output or the outcome of the execution useful and successfully leveraged ELITEA to achieve their intended goal. A higher Acceptance Rate signifies that ELITEA's functionalities are effectively meeting user needs and providing valuable assistance across various interaction types.</p>
<p><strong>Formula: Understanding the Broader Acceptance Calculation</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Acceptance Rate = (Accepted Interactions) / (All Interactions) * 100%
</code></pre>
<p>Let's understand the components of this formula in this broader context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numerator: Accepted Interactions:</strong> This represents the count of interactions where a user has performed a specific "acceptance action."  Crucially, "interactions" now encompass not only conversations but also direct executions of Prompts, Datasources, and Agents. An interaction is deemed "Accepted" when the user performs a relevant "<strong>acceptance action</strong>" signaling successful utilization of ELITEA's output or functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Denominator: All Interactions:</strong> This is the total count of <em>all</em> user interactions within the selected scope (Use Case, Project, timeframe, or entity type).  "Interactions" now include all attempts to utilize ELITEA, whether through conversations or direct executions of Prompts, Datasources, and Agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculation Period:</strong> The Acceptance Rate is calculated based on the <strong>"From" and "To" dates</strong> selected in the Filtering Panel, allowing you to analyze acceptance over different timeframes and across various types of interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Key Notes: Expanding the Definition of "Accepted Interactions"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Broader Scope of Acceptance Actions:</strong>  The definition of "Accepted Interactions" is now expanded to encompass a wider range of user actions that indicate successful utilization of ELITEA, regardless of whether the interaction occurs within a conversation or through direct entity execution.  "Acceptance actions" now include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword Acceptance within Agent Conversations (Explicit Approval):</strong> As before, for Agents designed with explicit approval steps, typing a pre-defined "acceptance keyword" (e.g., "approved," "publish") within a conversation is considered acceptance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Copying Actions:</strong>  Indicating user utilization of generated text or data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Text Selection and Copy:</strong>  Selecting and copying generated text directly from the ELITEA interface.</li>
<li><strong>"Copy to Clipboard" Button Usage:</strong> Clicking a "Copy to Clipboard" button associated with generated output.</li>
<li><strong>"Copy to Messages" Button Usage (Prompts):</strong>  Clicking a "Copy to Messages" button specifically available for Prompt executions, indicating the user is incorporating the prompt's output into a conversation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Table Export/Download Actions (Prompts):</strong> For Prompts that generate tabular data, utilizing export or download options signifies acceptance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Download as xlsx"</strong>: Downloading generated tables in Excel format.</li>
<li><strong>"Copy as html"</strong>: Copying table data in HTML format.</li>
<li><strong>"Copy as markdown"</strong>: Copying table data in Markdown format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agent Goal Completion Actions (External Service Interaction):</strong> For Agents designed to interact with external services, successful goal completion is considered acceptance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Creation in GitHub:</strong> Agents designed to create files in GitHub repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Issue Creation in Jira:</strong> Agents designed to create issues in Jira.</li>
<li><strong>Page Creation in Confluence:</strong> Agents designed to create pages in Confluence.</li>
<li>Any other Agent-specific action that signifies successful completion of its intended task in an external system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Datasource Specific Actions:</strong> Actions indicating utilization of data retrieved from Datasources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downloading Deduplication Results as Excel File:</strong> Downloading the output of deduplication processes from Datasources in Excel format.</li>
<li><strong>Copying Search Results:</strong> Copying search results obtained from Datasource queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Application:</strong> These "acceptance actions" are tracked and considered for Acceptance Rate calculations regardless of whether they occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Within Chat Conversations:</strong> When users interact with Prompts, Datasources, or Agents through the ELITEA Chat interface.</li>
<li><strong>During Direct Entity Execution:</strong> When users directly execute Prompts, Datasources, or Agents outside of a chat conversation, through other parts of the ELITEA interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Utilize Acceptance Rate for Broader Performance Improvement:</strong></p>
<p>The Acceptance Rate, now with its expanded definition, provides a comprehensive measure of user satisfaction and the effectiveness of ELITEA's AI capabilities across various interaction modes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify Areas of Friction and Success Across ELITEA:</strong>  A low Acceptance Rate, whether for a specific Use Case, a particular Prompt, a Datasource, or an Agent, points to potential areas of friction, usability issues, or output quality problems that need attention. Conversely, high Acceptance Rates highlight successful functionalities and well-performing entities that are effectively meeting user needs.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnose Issues Based on Interaction Type:</strong>  Analyze Acceptance Rates in conjunction with the "Type" and "Name" filters in the Monitoring Panel to pinpoint specific areas for improvement:<ul>
<li><strong>Low Prompt Acceptance Rate:</strong> Focus on the Prompt itself. Review the prompt's instructions, context, input parameters, and output examples. Experiment with prompt engineering techniques to improve output relevance, clarity, and accuracy. Consider user feedback on specific prompts to identify areas for refinement.</li>
<li><strong>Low Agent Acceptance Rate:</strong> Analyze the Agent's workflow, the quality of prompts and tools it utilizes, and its overall logic. Debug potential issues in the agent's execution flow, error handling, or interaction with external services.</li>
<li><strong>Low Datasource Acceptance Rate:</strong> Examine the Datasource's configuration, data quality, and query effectiveness. Ensure the datasource is providing relevant and accurate information for the intended use cases. Investigate if query parameters are being correctly mapped and if the datasource is reliably accessible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Comprehensive Acceptance Rate Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Review Remains Crucial:</strong> Continue to prioritize weekly reviews of Acceptance Rate metrics to proactively identify and address performance issues across all aspects of ELITEA.</li>
<li><strong>Granular Analysis by Type and Name:</strong> Leverage the "Type" and "Name" filters extensively to analyze Acceptance Rates not only by Use Case but also by individual Prompts, Datasources, and Agents. This granular view is essential for pinpointing specific AI artifacts or functionalities that require optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Timeframe for Consistency:</strong> Maintain the practice of using a weekly timeframe (e.g., Monday to Sunday of the previous week) for consistent and comparable Acceptance Rate tracking across different entities and time periods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Scenario (Expanded Scope):</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider a scenario where you are analyzing the Acceptance Rate for a specific Prompt, "User Story Creator Prompt," used within "Project Alpha" over the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total Executions of "User Story Creator Prompt" in "Project Gamma" last week (both within chats and direct executions): <strong>150</strong></li>
<li>Number of "Accepted Interactions" for "User Story Creator Prompt" (users copied output, downloaded table, etc.): <strong>75</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance Rate Calculation:</strong> (75 Accepted Interactions / 150 Total Interactions) * 100% = <strong>50%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> An Acceptance Rate of 50% for the "Code Summary Prompt" suggests that this particular prompt is only meeting user needs in half of its executions. This warrants a focused investigation into the prompt's design, output quality, and user expectations. You should review the prompt's instructions, analyze user feedback related to code summarization tasks, and potentially refine the prompt to improve its accuracy, clarity, and usefulness, aiming to increase its Acceptance Rate and ensure it effectively serves its intended purpose within ELITEA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This enhanced "Acceptance Rate" section now provides a much broader and more practical understanding of how to utilize this metric to assess the effectiveness of ELITEA's AI capabilities across Use Cases, Prompts, Datasources, and Agents, whether used in conversations or directly executed. Let me know if you have any further refinements!</p>
<h2 id="charts">Charts</h2>
<p>The <strong>Visual Metrics Panel</strong> in ELITEA Monitoring provides a rich set of charts and diagrams to help you visually analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators. This section provides a detailed explanation of each chart type, guiding you on how to interpret these visualizations to gain actionable insights into ELITEA usage and effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="adoption-and-usage-charts-tracking-user-activity-and-resource-consumption">Adoption and Usage Charts: Tracking User Activity and Resource Consumption</h3>
<p>These charts provide a visual representation of user adoption and overall application usage trends over time, as well as the consumption of LLM tokens.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Adoption_and_Usage" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Adoption_and_Usage.png" /></p>
<h4 id="active-users-chart-understanding-user-adoption-trends">Active Users Chart: Understanding User Adoption Trends</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Active Users Chart</strong> helps you visualize user adoption and engagement levels over time. It shows the number of unique active users for each time interval, allowing you to identify trends in user activity and pinpoint periods of high or low engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Stacked Bar Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents the <strong>Time Interval</strong>, based on the "Aggregation" level you select in the Filtering Panel (e.g., Day, Week, Month). Each bar on the chart corresponds to a specific time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Number of Users</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stacked Bars:</strong> Each bar is divided into two stacked segments, representing:<ul>
<li><strong>Active Users (Teal/Green segment):</strong> The number of <em>active</em> users during that time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Inactive Users (Light Gray segment):</strong> The number of <em>inactive</em> users (users with "Monitor" role who did <em>not</em> perform any "active" actions) during that time interval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Observe the overall trend of the teal/green "active users" bars over time. An upward trend indicates increasing user adoption and engagement, while a downward trend may signal declining interest or usability issues.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Peak and Low Activity Periods:</strong>  Visually identify time intervals (days, weeks, etc.) with the highest and lowest bars for "active users." This can help you understand when ELITEA is most and least utilized.</li>
<li><strong>Active vs. Inactive User Ratio:</strong>  Compare the relative sizes of the teal/green "active users" segment and the light gray "inactive users" segment within each bar. A larger teal/green segment indicates a higher proportion of active users for that period, signifying stronger engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Active Users Chart" shows consistently increasing teal/green bars over the past few weeks, it indicates positive user adoption and growing engagement with ELITEA. Conversely, if you see a sudden drop in the height of the teal/green bars for a recent week, it might warrant investigation into potential issues affecting user engagement during that period.</p>
<h4 id="token-usage-chart-monitoring-llm-resource-consumption">Token Usage Chart: Monitoring LLM Resource Consumption</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Token Usage Chart</strong> is essential for monitoring the consumption of LLM resources within ELITEA. It visualizes the trend of tokens sent to LLMs (Tokens Out - input tokens) and tokens received from LLMs (Tokens In - output tokens) over time, helping you understand the computational demand and potential costs associated with ELITEA usage.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Line Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents the <strong>Time Interval</strong>, based on the "Aggregation" level you select in the Filtering Panel (e.g., Day, Week, Month). Each point on the lines corresponds to a specific time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Number of Tokens</strong>, typically measured in thousands (e.g., 50k, 100k, 150k).</li>
<li><strong>Lines:</strong> The chart displays two distinct lines, each representing a type of token usage:<ul>
<li><strong>Tokens In (Teal/Cyan Line):</strong>  Represents the number of tokens <strong>generated by LLMs and sent back to ELITEA</strong> (output tokens).</li>
<li><strong>Tokens Out (Magenta/Purple Line):</strong> Represents the number of tokens <strong>sent <em>to</em> the LLMs by ELITEA</strong> (input tokens).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Token Usage Trends:</strong> Observe the overall trends of both the "Tokens In" (teal/cyan) and "Tokens Out" (magenta/purple) lines over time. Upward trends indicate increasing LLM resource consumption, while downward trends suggest decreasing usage or more efficient workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Input vs. Output Token Ratio:</strong> Compare the relative positions and trends of the two lines.  Significant differences in the volume of input vs. output tokens might indicate specific usage patterns or potential areas for optimization. For example, consistently high "Tokens Out" with relatively lower "Tokens In" might suggest users are sending complex or lengthy queries.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Token Spikes:</strong> Look for sudden spikes or peaks in either the "Tokens In" or "Tokens Out" lines. These spikes can highlight periods of unusually high LLM usage, which might warrant further investigation to understand the cause (e.g., a specific event, a new Use Case being heavily utilized).</li>
<li><strong>Cost Monitoring (Indirect):</strong> While the chart doesn't directly display costs, tracking token usage trends is crucial for cost management, as LLM usage is often billed based on token consumption. Monitoring this chart helps you anticipate potential cost fluctuations and optimize workflows to minimize unnecessary token usage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Token Usage Chart" shows a sharp increase in the "Tokens Out" (magenta/purple) line during a particular week, it indicates a surge in input tokens sent to LLMs. This could be due to increased user activity, more complex queries being submitted, or a change in Use Case usage patterns. Further investigation, potentially combined with other monitoring data, can help pinpoint the cause of this token usage spike.</p>
<h3 id="acceptance-rate-chart-measuring-user-satisfaction-with-ai-outputs">Acceptance Rate Chart: Measuring User Satisfaction with AI Outputs</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Acceptance Rate Chart</strong> visually represents the overall user satisfaction with the outputs generated by ELITEA. It shows the proportion of user interactions where users took "acceptance actions" (indicating satisfaction) versus those where they did not. This chart provides a direct measure of how well ELITEA is meeting user needs and delivering valuable results.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Acceptance_Rate" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Acceptance_Rate.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Stacked Bar Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents the <strong>Time Interval</strong>, based on the "Aggregation" level you select in the Filtering Panel (e.g., Day, Week, Month). Each bar corresponds to a specific time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Number of Interactions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stacked Bars:</strong> Each bar is divided into two stacked segments, representing:<ul>
<li><strong>Accepted Interactions (Teal/Green segment):</strong> The number of user interactions during that time interval that were classified as "Accepted" based on user actions (copying output, downloading, explicit approval, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Not Accepted Interactions (Light Gray segment):</strong> The number of user interactions during that time interval where users did <em>not</em> perform any "acceptance actions."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Acceptance Trend:</strong> Observe the overall trend of the teal/green "Accepted Interactions" bars over time. An upward trend indicates increasing user satisfaction and more effective Use Cases, Prompts, Datasources, or Agents. A downward trend may signal declining user satisfaction or issues with output quality or relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Periods of High and Low Acceptance:</strong> Visually identify time intervals with the highest and lowest bars for "Accepted Interactions." This can help correlate acceptance rates with specific events, changes in Use Cases, or other factors.</li>
<li><strong>Accepted vs. Not Accepted Ratio:</strong> Compare the relative sizes of the teal/green "Accepted Interactions" segment and the light gray "Not Accepted Interactions" segment within each bar. A larger teal/green segment indicates a higher Acceptance Rate for that period, signifying greater user satisfaction and perceived value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Acceptance Rate Chart" shows consistently tall teal/green bars, dominating the light gray "Not Accepted" segments, it indicates a high overall Acceptance Rate and suggests that ELITEA is effectively meeting user needs and generating valuable outputs. Conversely, if you observe a significant increase in the light gray "Not Accepted" segments, particularly for a specific Use Case or time period, it warrants investigation into potential issues affecting user satisfaction and output quality.</p>
<h3 id="sentiments-charts-understanding-user-and-ai-tone">Sentiments Charts: Understanding User and AI Tone</h3>
<p>These pie charts provide a quick visual overview of the emotional tone expressed in user inputs and generated LLM outputs, helping you assess the overall user experience and the sentiment conveyed by the AI.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Sentiments" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Sentiments.png" /></p>
<h4 id="human-input-chart-analyzing-user-sentiment">Human Input Chart: Analyzing User Sentiment</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Human Input Chart</strong> visualizes the distribution of sentiment expressed in user inputs to ELITEA. By analyzing the sentiment of user queries and instructions, you can gain insights into user attitudes, potential frustrations, and areas where users might be expressing negative sentiment that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Pie Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pie Chart Slices:</strong> The pie chart is divided into three slices, each representing a sentiment category:<ul>
<li><strong>Positive (Green slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of user inputs classified as having a positive sentiment (e.g., expressing satisfaction, appreciation, optimism).</li>
<li><strong>Negative (Orange slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of user inputs classified as having a negative sentiment (e.g., expressing frustration, dissatisfaction, criticism).</li>
<li><strong>Neutral (Light Blue slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of user inputs classified as having a neutral sentiment (e.g., factual questions, objective statements, requests without emotional tone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Sentiment Balance:</strong>  Examine the relative sizes of the pie chart slices to understand the overall sentiment balance in user inputs. A larger green "Positive" slice is generally desirable, indicating a positive user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Negative Sentiment Trends:</strong>  Pay attention to the size of the orange "Negative" slice. A consistently large or increasing "Negative" slice might signal user frustration, usability issues, or problems with output quality that are causing negative sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral Sentiment as Baseline:</strong> The light blue "Neutral" slice represents a baseline level of objective or unemotional communication. While a high "Neutral" percentage is not necessarily negative, it's important to consider the context. In some cases, a shift from "Neutral" to "Positive" might be a desirable outcome of improvements to ELITEA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Human Input Chart" shows a large green "Positive" slice and small orange "Negative" and light blue "Neutral" slices, it indicates that users are generally expressing positive sentiment in their interactions with ELITEA, suggesting a positive user experience. Conversely, a larger orange "Negative" slice might prompt further investigation into potential usability issues or areas of user dissatisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="llm-output-chart-assessing-ai-tone-and-positivity">LLM Output Chart: Assessing AI Tone and Positivity</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>LLM Output Chart</strong> visualizes the distribution of sentiment expressed in the outputs generated by ELITEA's Large Language Models (LLMs). Analyzing the sentiment of LLM responses is crucial for ensuring that the AI is communicating in a helpful, positive, and appropriate tone, contributing to a positive user experience and avoiding unintended negative or unhelpful communication styles.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Pie Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pie Chart Slices:</strong> Similar to the "<strong>Human Input Chart</strong>" this pie chart is also divided into three slices, each representing a sentiment category for LLM outputs:<ul>
<li><strong>Positive (Green slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of LLM outputs classified as having a positive sentiment (e.g., helpful, encouraging, supportive, optimistic).</li>
<li><strong>Negative (Orange slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of LLM outputs classified as having a negative sentiment (e.g., unhelpful, discouraging, critical, pessimistic).</li>
<li><strong>Neutral (Light Blue slice):</strong> Represents the percentage of LLM outputs classified as having a neutral sentiment (e.g., factual responses, objective information, task-oriented outputs without emotional tone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desired Positive AI Tone:</strong> Aim for a large green "Positive" slice in the "LLM Output Chart." This indicates that ELITEA's AI is generally communicating in a positive and helpful tone, contributing to a positive user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Negative LLM Sentiment:</strong>  The orange "Negative" slice should ideally be minimal. A significant or increasing "Negative" slice in LLM outputs is a cause for concern. It might indicate issues with prompt design, agent logic, or underlying LLM behavior that are causing the AI to generate unhelpful, critical, or negatively toned responses.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Neutrality:</strong>  The light blue "Neutral" slice represents a baseline of objective and task-focused AI communication. While neutrality is often appropriate for factual responses, consider whether a higher proportion of "Positive" sentiment in LLM outputs could further enhance user engagement and satisfaction, depending on the specific Use Case and context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "LLM Output Chart" shows a dominant green "Positive" slice, with minimal orange "Negative" and a moderate light blue "Neutral" slice, it suggests that ELITEA's AI is generally communicating in a helpful and positive manner. However, if you observe a noticeable increase in the orange "Negative" slice, it's crucial to investigate the prompts, agents, or configurations that are leading to these negatively toned outputs and take corrective actions to ensure the AI communicates in a more positive and constructive way.</p>
<h3 id="accuracy-charts-assessing-relevance-and-reliability">Accuracy Charts: Assessing Relevance and Reliability</h3>
<p>These charts provide quantitative measures of the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of ELITEA's AI-powered interactions, helping you evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of the generated outputs and data retrievals.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Accuracy" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Accuracy.png" /></p>
<h4 id="relevance-chart-measuring-input-and-output-alignment">Relevance Chart: Measuring Input and Output Alignment</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Relevance Chart</strong> helps you assess the relevance of user inputs to the intended context and the relevance of LLM outputs to the user inputs they are responding to. By tracking relevance scores over time, you can monitor the quality of interactions and identify potential issues with input clarity or output alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Line Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents the <strong>Time Interval</strong>, based on the "Aggregation" level you select in the Filtering Panel (e.g., Day, Week, Month). Each point on the lines corresponds to a specific time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Relevance Score</strong>, typically on a scale from 0 to 5 or 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Lines:</strong> The chart displays two distinct lines, each representing a type of relevance score:<ul>
<li><strong>Input vs. Context (Teal/Cyan Line):</strong> Represents the average relevance score of <strong>user inputs compared to the intended context</strong> of the interaction (e.g., the topic of the Use Case, the purpose of the prompt). Higher scores indicate that user inputs are generally well-aligned with the expected context.</li>
<li><strong>Output vs. Input (Magenta/Purple Line):</strong> Represents the average relevance score of <strong>LLM outputs compared to the user inputs</strong> they are responding to. Higher scores indicate that LLM outputs are generally relevant and responsive to user queries and instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance Score Trends:</strong> Observe the trends of both the "Input vs. Context" (teal/cyan) and "Output vs. Input" (magenta/purple) lines over time. Ideally, you want to see consistently high relevance scores for both, indicating that user inputs are clear and focused, and LLM outputs are relevant and on-topic.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Relevance Dips:</strong> Look for dips or downward trends in either relevance line. A drop in "Input vs. Context" relevance might suggest users are providing less focused or less relevant inputs, potentially due to confusion or usability issues. A drop in "Output vs. Input" relevance might indicate problems with prompt design, agent logic, or LLM performance, leading to less relevant or off-topic outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Compare Input and Output Relevance:</strong> Compare the relative levels of the two relevance lines. Ideally, you want both lines to be consistently high and relatively close to each other, indicating a good flow of relevant information between users and the AI system. Significant divergence between the lines might warrant further investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Relevance Chart" shows both the "Input vs. Context" and "Output vs. Input" lines consistently above a score of 4 (on a 0-5 scale), it suggests a high degree of relevance in ELITEA interactions. Users are generally providing relevant inputs, and the AI is generating relevant and responsive outputs. However, if you notice a dip in the "Output vs. Input" line below a certain threshold, it might indicate a need to review and refine the prompts or agents responsible for generating those less relevant outputs.</p>
<h4 id="reliability-chart-assessing-llm-response-consistency">Reliability Chart: Assessing LLM Response Consistency</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Reliability Chart</strong> focuses specifically on the reliability of LLM responses, measuring the consistency and predictability of the AI's output quality over time. A high Reliability score indicates that the LLM is generating consistently dependable and trustworthy responses.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Line Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents the <strong>Time Interval</strong>, based on the "Aggregation" level you select in the Filtering Panel (e.g., Day, Week, Month). Each point on the line corresponds to a specific time interval.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Reliability Score</strong>, typically on a scale from 0 to 10 or a percentage scale, where higher scores indicate greater reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability Score Line (Teal/Cyan Line):</strong>  A single line representing the average reliability score of LLM responses for each time interval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability Trend:</strong> Observe the trend of the teal/cyan "Reliability Score" line over time. A consistently high and stable line is desirable, indicating that the LLM is providing dependable and consistent responses.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Reliability Drops:</strong> Look for dips or downward trends in the Reliability Score line. A drop in reliability might signal issues with the LLM model itself, changes in the input data quality, or problems with the prompts or agents that are relying on the LLM.</li>
<li><strong>Benchmark against Target Reliability:</strong>  Establish a target reliability score for your ELITEA implementation. Use the Reliability Chart to monitor whether the average reliability score is consistently meeting or exceeding your target.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Reliability Chart" shows the "Reliability Score" line consistently above 8 (on a 0-10 scale), it suggests that ELITEA's LLM responses are generally highly reliable and consistent. However, if you observe a sudden drop in the Reliability Score below your target threshold, it might indicate a need to investigate potential issues affecting LLM performance or consistency, such as model updates, changes in API configurations, or underlying data quality problems.</p>
<h4 id="instruction-quality-vs-usage-matrix-optimizing-ai-artifacts">Instruction Quality vs. Usage Matrix: Optimizing AI Artifacts</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Instruction Quality vs. Usage Matrix</strong> is a powerful 2x2 matrix visualization designed to help you optimize your ELITEA Prompts (and potentially Agents or Datasources in future iterations). It plots the relationship between the "Quality Score" of your Prompts and their "Usage" frequency, allowing you to identify high-performing, underutilized, or low-quality prompts for targeted improvement efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> 2x2 Matrix (Scatter Plot within Quadrants)</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents <strong>Usage (#Calls)</strong>, indicating the number of times each Prompt has been executed or called within the selected timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents <strong>Quality Score</strong>, reflecting a composite score that combines metrics like Relevance and Reliability to assess the overall quality and effectiveness of each Prompt's instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Quadrants:</strong> The matrix is divided into four quadrants, each representing a combination of Instruction Quality and Usage levels:<ul>
<li><strong>Low Quality, Low Usage (Bottom-Left Quadrant):</strong> Contains Prompts with both low Quality Scores and low Usage frequency. These are typically prompts that are underperforming and not being actively utilized.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, Low Usage (Top-Left Quadrant):</strong> Contains Prompts with high Quality Scores but low Usage frequency. These are potentially valuable prompts that are not being leveraged to their full potential.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, High Usage (Top-Right Quadrant):</strong> Contains Prompts with both high Quality Scores and high Usage frequency. These are your top-performing and most valuable prompts, effectively meeting user needs and being actively utilized.</li>
<li><strong>Low Quality, High Usage (Bottom-Right Quadrant):</strong> Contains Prompts with low Quality Scores but surprisingly high Usage frequency. These are prompts that are being used frequently despite their lower quality, potentially indicating a critical need for improvement or that users are using them despite their limitations due to lack of better alternatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Points:</strong> Each data point on the matrix represents a <strong>Prompt</strong>. The position of the data point within the matrix is determined by its "Quality Score" (Y-axis) and "#Calls" (X-axis). Hovering over a data point typically reveals the name of the Prompt it represents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify High-Value Prompts (Top-Right Quadrant):</strong> Focus on the Prompts located in the "High Quality, High Usage" (top-right) quadrant. These are your most valuable assets. Analyze these prompts to understand what makes them successful (e.g., clear instructions, relevant context, effective prompt engineering techniques). Leverage these insights to improve other prompts.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize Underutilized High-Quality Prompts (Top-Left Quadrant):</strong> Prompts in the "High Quality, Low Usage" (top-left) quadrant represent untapped potential. Investigate why these high-quality prompts are not being used more frequently. Potential reasons include:
        *   <strong>Lack of User Awareness:</strong> Users may not know about these valuable prompts. Promote these prompts through training, documentation, or in-app discovery features.
        *   <strong>Discoverability Issues:</strong> Make sure these prompts are easily discoverable and accessible within the ELITEA interface.
        *   <strong>Limited Use Cases:</strong> Explore if the use cases for these prompts can be expanded or better communicated to users.</li>
<li><strong>Improve or Retire Low-Quality Prompts (Bottom-Left Quadrant):</strong> Prompts in the "Low Quality, Low Usage" (bottom-left) quadrant are likely underperforming and not providing value. Consider these options:
        *   <strong>Improve and Refine:</strong> Analyze these prompts to identify specific weaknesses in their instructions, context, or logic. Invest time in prompt engineering to improve their quality and relevance.
        *   <strong>Retire or Deprecate:</strong> If improvement efforts are not successful, or if these prompts are no longer relevant, consider retiring or deprecating them to avoid user confusion and focus on higher-value assets.</li>
<li><strong>Address Low-Quality, High-Usage Prompts (Bottom-Right Quadrant - Critical Attention Needed):</strong> Prompts in the "Low Quality, High Usage" (bottom-right) quadrant are a critical area for attention. These prompts are being used frequently <em>despite</em> their low quality, which is a potential problem. This situation might indicate:
        *   <strong>Critical Need:</strong> Users may be using these low-quality prompts because they address a critical need for which no better alternatives exist within ELITEA.
        *   <strong>User Frustration:</strong> Users might be experiencing frustration and reduced productivity due to the low quality of these frequently used prompts.
        *   <strong>Prioritize Improvement:</strong> <strong>Prioritize immediate improvement efforts for prompts in this quadrant.</strong>  Focus on significantly enhancing their quality and relevance to better meet the needs of users who are relying on them heavily.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> By examining the "Instruction Quality vs. Usage Matrix," you might identify that your "Code Documentation Prompt" is located in the "High Quality, High Usage" quadrant, indicating it's a valuable and well-utilized asset. On the other hand, you might find a "Competitor Analysis Prompt" in the "Low Quality, High Usage" quadrant, signaling a critical need to improve this prompt to better serve the users who are frequently relying on it, despite its current shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="topics-chart-understanding-content-distribution">Topics Chart: Understanding Content Distribution</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Topics Chart</strong> provides a visual representation of how your ELITEA Prompts, Datasources, and Agents are distributed across different identified topics or categories. This chart helps you understand the content focus of your AI artifacts and identify areas where you have strong content coverage and areas where you might need to expand your topic coverage.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Topics" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Topics.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Clustered Column Chart</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents <strong>Topics</strong> identified within ELITEA (e.g., "User Stories," "Code Documentation," "Competitive Analysis," "Confluence Pages"). Each cluster of columns corresponds to a specific topic.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Number of Items (# Items)</strong>, indicating the count of ELITEA entities associated with each topic.</li>
<li><strong>Clustered Columns:</strong> For each topic on the X-axis, you will see a cluster of columns, with each column representing a different type of ELITEA entity:<ul>
<li><strong>Prompts (Teal/Cyan Column):</strong>  The number of Prompts categorized under that topic.</li>
<li><strong>Datasources (Light Blue Column):</strong> The number of Datasources categorized under that topic.</li>
<li><strong>Agents (Magenta/Purple Column):</strong> The number of Agents categorized under that topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic Coverage Distribution:</strong> Examine the overall distribution of columns across different topics. This chart provides a visual overview of which topics are well-represented by your ELITEA content (Prompts, Datasources, Agents) and which topics have less coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Content Gaps:</strong> Look for topics on the X-axis that have very short or missing columns, indicating a lack of Prompts, Datasources, or Agents related to those topics. These "gaps" represent potential areas where you need to create new AI artifacts to expand ELITEA's content coverage and address user needs in those areas.</li>
<li><strong>Content Focus Areas:</strong> Identify topics with tall columns across all entity types (Prompts, Datasources, Agents). These "focus areas" represent topics where you have a strong and well-developed set of AI resources within ELITEA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Prompt Topics Chart" shows tall columns for "User Stories" and "Code Documentation" but very short or no columns for "Competitive Analysis," it indicates that your ELITEA implementation has strong content coverage for user story creation and code documentation tasks, but lacks resources for competitive analysis. This might prompt you to prioritize the creation of new Prompts, Datasources, or Agents focused on competitive analysis to address this content gap and expand ELITEA's capabilities in that area.</p>
<h3 id="topics-summary-chart-understanding-user-query-focus">Topics Summary Chart: Understanding User Query Focus</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The <strong>Topics Summary Chart</strong> provides insights into the topics that users are most frequently querying and interacting with within ELITEA. By analyzing the distribution of user queries across different topics, you can understand user interests, identify popular areas of focus, and ensure that your ELITEA content and functionalities are aligned with user demand.</p>
<p><img alt="Monitoring-Charts_Topics_Summary" src="../../../img/guides/monitoring/Monitoring-Charts_Topics_Summary.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Chart Type:</strong> Clustered Column Chart (Single Cluster per Topic)</p>
<p><strong>Data Displayed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents <strong>Topics</strong> identified within ELITEA (consistent with the "Prompt Topics Chart" - e.g., "User Stories," "Code Documentation," "Competitive Analysis," "Confluence Pages"). Each column corresponds to a specific topic.</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the <strong>Number of Items (# Items)</strong>, indicating the count of user queries associated with each topic.</li>
<li><strong>Columns:</strong> For each topic on the X-axis, you will see a single column representing:<ul>
<li><strong>User Queries (Teal/Cyan Column):</strong> The number of user queries (or interactions) that have been categorized as belonging to that specific topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Interest Distribution:</strong> Examine the relative heights of the columns across different topics. This chart visually represents the distribution of user interest across various topics within ELITEA. Taller columns indicate topics that users are querying more frequently, signifying higher user interest and demand.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Popular Topics:</strong> Pinpoint topics with the tallest columns. These are the most popular areas of user interest within ELITEA. Ensure that you have robust and high-quality content (Prompts, Datasources, Agents) available to effectively address user queries and needs in these popular topic areas.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Under-Queried Topics:</strong> Look for topics with short or very short columns. These are topics that users are querying less frequently. This might indicate:
        *   <strong>Lack of User Awareness:</strong> Users might not be aware that ELITEA has capabilities related to these topics. Consider promoting these functionalities through training or in-app communication.
        *   <strong>Limited User Need:</strong> There might be genuinely less user demand for information or assistance related to these topics.
        *   <strong>Relevance Issues:</strong>  The existing content related to these topics might not be sufficiently relevant or useful to users, leading to lower query frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the "Topics Summary Chart" shows a very tall column for "User Stories" and significantly shorter columns for other topics like "Code Documentation" or "Competitive Analysis," it indicates that user interest and demand within ELITEA are heavily focused on user story-related tasks and information. This insight might prompt you to prioritize further development and optimization of Use Cases, Prompts, and Agents related to user stories to cater to this high user demand. You might also consider investigating why other topics are less frequently queried and explore strategies to increase user awareness or improve content relevance in those areas.</p>
<p>By utilizing these detailed chart explanations and understanding how to interpret the visualizations provided by ELITEA Monitoring, you can gain valuable insights into application usage, user behavior, AI artifact performance, and content effectiveness, enabling data-driven decisions to continuously improve and optimize your ELITEA implementation.</p>
