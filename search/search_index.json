Available options include: File : Any supported file type for upload. Table : Supported file types with a table structure, such as CSV or XLSX. GIT : Any accessible Git repository. Confluence : Any Confluence page accessible to you. Depending on the selected source type, various configurations may be necessary to access the dataset source, primarily involving authentication and authorization parameters. This step is exempt for File and Table options since the files will be directly uploaded. Source type - File Alita supports a variety of file types and offers flexible settings to handle your documents effectively. Below is an easy-to-understand breakdown of the options, settings, and parameters available for configuration. Name - specify a unique name for your source configuration. This helps in easily identifying and managing multiple sources. Choose File Option - select the file you wish to process. Alita supports a range of commonly used file types, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. Supported File Types: PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON. Advanced Settings - under this section, additional features enable further customization of how your file is processed. Split Pages - when enabled, each page of your document is treated as a separate entity. This is particularly useful when dealing with PDF documents, enabling more granular control over the analysis or processing of individual pages. Parse Tables by Rows Selecting this option ensures that any tables within your document are parsed row by row, maintaining the structure and context. This setting is valuable when dealing with documents that contain tabular information, ensuring the data remains organized and comprehensible. Default Document Loader - choose the mechanism by which your document is loaded into the system. Each loader handles your file differently, catering to specific needs. TextLoader - optimized for plain text documents, ensuring swift and efficient loading. PythonLoader - best suited for technical or coded documents, offering more sophisticated parsing capabilities. Extension Whitelist - specify file extensions that are explicitly allowed. This security measure ensures only designated file types are processed, safeguarding against unwanted or potentially harmful files. List the extensions separated by commas (e.g., pdf, docx, txt), overriding the default supported types if necessary. Extension Blacklist - conversely, list file extensions you wish to exclude from processing. Any file type mentioned here will be automatically rejected, further enhancing security and control over the documents your system handles. Source type - Table This functionality is crucial for users who work with structured data in formats such as spreadsheets or structured text files. The aim is to make the process straightforward for users without requiring deep technical knowledge. Here, we outline the options, settings, and parameters available for your table data sources. Name - specify a unique name for your source configuration. This helps in easily identifying and managing multiple sources. Choose File Option - select the file you wish to process. Alita supports a range of commonly used file types, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. Supported File Types: CSV, JSON, XLSX. Columns - specify which column(s) within your table you want to focus on. These columns should contain the data you wish to analyze or use for generating embeddings. You can select single or multiple columns depending on your requirement. This flexibility allows you to tailor the analysis to the specific data points that are most valuable to your objectives. JSON Documents - enable this option if your table data is structured as JSON documents, particularly relevant when dealing with JSON files. This tells the system to parse the file as a collection of JSON entries, allowing for a more nuanced understanding and utilization of nested data structures within the file. Raw Content - when enabled, this setting ensures that your selected data is treated as raw content, bypassing any default preprocessing or formatting. This is particularly useful when you want the data to be ingested in its purest form, without any alterations that might affect its original structure or meaning. Source type - GIT For users who rely on Git repositories to manage their code, documents, or other types of projects, this source type allows to streamline the process of linking and extracting data from these repositories. Here, we outline the options, settings, and parameters available for your GIT source type. Name - specify a unique name for your source configuration. This helps in easily identifying and managing multiple sources. URL - link to Git Repo. To connect to your Git repository, you'll need to provide the URL. Alita supports two types of Git repository links: SSH - for a secure and password-less connection. If you choose this option, an SSH key pair is required, with the public key added to your Git account and the private key entered in the subsequent SSH Key field. HTTPS - a widely used method that might require username and password authentication based on the repository's access settings. Depending on your preference for SSH or HTTPS, ensure you provide the necessary authentication credentials as described: For SSH : input the SSH Key in the designated field. For HTTPS : if prompted, enter the username and password to authenticate. Branch - here, specify the branch within your Git repository you wish to access. By default, the ' main ' branch is selected, but you may adjust this to any branch name that suits your current focus or project needs. Advanced Settings - under this tab, we offer options to further customize how data is retrieved from your Git repository. Multithreading - enabling multithreading can significantly speed up the process of fetching data from your Git repo, especially beneficial for large repositories or when network latency is a concern. This option allows the system to perform multiple operations in parallel, reducing overall extraction time. Default Document Loader - choose the mechanism by which your document is loaded into the system. Each loader handles your file differently, catering to specific needs. TextLoader : - optimized for plain text documents, ensuring swift and efficient loading. PythonLoader : - best suited for technical or coded documents, offering more sophisticated parsing capabilities. Extension Whitelist - specify file extensions that are explicitly allowed. This security measure ensures only designated file types are processed, safeguarding against unwanted or potentially harmful files. List the extensions separated by commas (e.g., pdf, docx, txt), overriding the default supported types if necessary. Extension Blacklist - conversely, list file extensions you wish to exclude from processing. Any file type mentioned here will be automatically rejected, further enhancing security and control over the documents your system handles. Source type - Confluence For users who rely on Confluence pages to manage their information, documents, or other types of projects, this source type allows to streamline the process of linking and extracting data from these knowledge pages. Here, we outline the options, settings, and parameters available for your Confluence source type. Name - specify a unique name for your source configuration. This helps in easily identifying and managing multiple sources. URL - link to Confluence. To connect to your Confluence KB, you'll need to provide the URL.

Token : Similarly, if the Token option suits you better, you'll have to create an authentication Token from your Confluence user settings and enter it in the Token field. Note : These authentication methods ensure secure access to your Confluence content, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your data. Username - input the username associated with your Confluence account. This is the same username you use to log in to your Confluence site. Hosting Option - choose the appropriate hosting type for your Confluence setup: Cloud - if your Confluence is hosted on Atlassian\u2019s cloud. Server - if your Confluence is hosted on your own servers or enterprise environment. Note :This distinction is crucial for establishing the correct connection and accessing your data appropriately. Filter - use the filter option to refine which Confluence pages you wish to fetch. You can filter by: Space Key - to fetch pages from specific Confluence spaces. Page IDs - to target specific pages. Labels - to retrieve pages tagged with specific labels. Note :These filters help in narrowing down to the most relevant content for your needs, enhancing efficiency. Advanced Settings - these settings offer additional controls over how your Confluence content is fetched and presented: Include Attachment - check this if you want to include page attachments in your data fetch.

How to Setup Messages The MESSAGES section is a crucial component that allows users to structure the flow of interaction within a prompt. System message - a system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to LLM, such as specifying a particular goal or role for LLM before asking it a question or giving it a task. Assistant message - an Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries User message, on the other hand, exemplifies what a real human user might say or ask within a given scenario. To enhance the interactivity of a prompt, user can add multiple messages of any type by clicking the + icon, selecting the desired message type, and providing the relevant content. Additionally, user have the ability to delete, copy, and reorder messages to best fit the flow of the conversation, easily arranging them by dragging and dropping the message boxes as needed for optimal organization and presentation. How to Use Variables The variables within prompts add a layer of dynamic customization, allowing you to tailor prompts to specific needs or contexts. Variables are denoted by double curly brackets (e.g., {{variable_name}}) and should be defined in the prompt's Context input box. Once a variable is entered into the CONTEXT, it automatically populates the VARIABLES section, where you can assign a value to that variable. This feature empowers users to create flexible and reusable prompts that can be easily adapted by changing the values of the variables as needed, without altering the entire prompt structure. Note : User has the flexibility to define one or more variables in each prompt. Variables can also be defined in Messages . How to Execute Prompt To execute the prompt and get the output you have 2 options: Chat - is a specific type of input designed for conversational AI models, which aims to initiate or guide a dialogue. This can be in the form of a question, statement, or command that simulates human-like interaction, prompting the AI to produce a conversational response for engagement. Completion - is supplied to generative AI models, such as text or code generators, with the intent of the model continuing or completing the given input. The AI uses the context provided in the prompt to produce a coherent and contextually relevant extension or completion of the text.
