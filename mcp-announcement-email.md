# New Feature: ELITEA Now Supports MCP Integration

Dear ELITEA Users,

We're excited to announce that **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support** is now available in ELITEA, enabling you to use your ELITEA agents directly within VS Code through GitHub Copilot Chat!

## Integration Options

**Two flexible transport methods available:**
- **SSE Transport**: One-way communication for web applications (ELITEA → Your Product)
- **STDIO Transport**: Two-way communication for local development (ELITEA ↔ Your Product)

## Quick Start

1. Tag your agents with `mcp` in ELITEA
2. Connect VS Code to ELITEA's MCP server (requires VS Code 1.99+)
3. Use your agents as tools in GitHub Copilot Chat

## Key Features

- Use ELITEA agents without leaving your IDE
- Configure at workspace or user level
- Access powerful tools like BA Assistant for Jira enhancements

## Documentation

Visit our detailed guides:
- [SSE Transport Guide](https://docs.elitea.ai/how-tos/mcp-server/)
- [STDIO Transport Guide](https://docs.elitea.ai/how-tos/mcp-server-stdio/)

**Note**: If you have agents with identical names, only one will be fetched. Consider using unique names to ensure all agents are available.
