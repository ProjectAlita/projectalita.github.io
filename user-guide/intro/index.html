<p>The <strong>Prompt Quality vs Usage</strong> is a 2x2 matrix that helps you evaluate the effectiveness and utilization of your artifacts (prompts, agents, datasources or conversations):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Quality, Low Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have low quality scores and are rarely used. These artifacts may need to be re-evaluated or improved.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, Low Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have high quality scores but are not frequently used. Efforts should be made to promote these high-quality artifacts to increase their usage.</li>
<li><strong>High Quality, High Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have high quality scores and are frequently used. These are your most effective artifacts and should be maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Low Quality, High Usage</strong>: Artifacts in this box have low quality scores but are frequently used. These artifacts should be improved in quality or their usage should be reduced in favor of higher-quality alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matrix legend</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Score</strong>: The maximum quality score is 4. A higher score indicates better quality.</li>
