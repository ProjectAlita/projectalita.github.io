## Toolkit Account Setup and Configuration in TestIO

### Account Setup

TestIO is a commercial crowdtesting platform. To use the TestIO Toolkit, you will need an active TestIO account. If you do not have a TestIO account, you will need to obtain one through your organization or directly with TestIO.

### Token/API Key Generation: Obtaining a TestIO Personal Access Token

For secure integration with ELITEA, it is essential to use a TestIO **Personal Access Token** for authentication. This method is more secure than using your primary TestIO account password directly and allows you to control access permissions for ELITEA.

**Follow these steps to obtain a Personal Access Token in TestIO:**

1.  **Request Access (if needed):** If you do not already have access to generate Personal Access Tokens, consult the TestIO documentation or contact TestIO support (or your TestIO Customer Success Manager/development team contact) to request access.

2.  **Generate Personal Access Token:** Once access is granted, navigate to the TestIO API Integrations page using the following URL (you may need to be logged into TestIO via SSO):  [https://epamglobal.test.io/api_integrations](https://epamglobal.test.io/api_integrations) *(Note: This URL may vary depending on your specific TestIO environment. Confirm with your TestIO contact if needed.)*

3.  **Sign in with SSO:** Log in to TestIO using your Single Sign-On credentials if prompted.

4.  **Create a New Token:** Follow the instructions on the TestIO API Integrations page to generate a new Personal Access Token. Give the token a descriptive name (e.g., "ELITEA Integration Token").

5.  **Securely Copy the Token:** **Important:** Copy the generated Personal Access Token and store it securely. You will need this token to configure the TestIO Toolkit in ELITEA. Treat this token like a password â€“ keep it confidential.

## System Integration with ELITEA: TestIO Toolkit Configuration

### Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate the TestIO Toolkit into an ELITEA agent:

1.  **Navigate to Alitea Agents:** Access the Agent section within your ELITEA instance.

2.  **Create or Edit an Agent:** Select an existing agent or create a new agent by clicking "Create Agent".

3.  **Agent Configuration:** Configure the agent with a relevant **Agent Name**, **Description**, **Instructions**, and **Agent Type** suitable for your intended use case (e.g., an "OpenAI Agent" type for general-purpose interaction).
    *   **Crucial: Agent Instructions:** Within the agent's instructions, clearly define any required parameters that the agent will need, to use the TestIO tools, such as `productId` and `testCaseTestId`. Provide examples of how to obtain these IDs from TestIO.

## Integration Helpdesk and Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1.  **Integration Failure - Connection or Authentication Errors:**
    *   **Problem:** ELITEA agent fails to connect to TestIO or encounters authentication errors when using TestIO tools.
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        *   **Check API Key:** Verify that the Personal Access Token entered in the "API Key" field (or secret) is correct, has been copied accurately, and is valid.
        *   **API Endpoint URL:** Confirm that the "API Endpoint" URL is correctly set to `https://api.test.io` (or the correct environment-specific URL if applicable).
        *   **Token Validity and Permissions:** Ensure the Personal Access Token is still valid in TestIO and has not been revoked. While TestIO Personal Access Tokens generally have broad access, confirm with TestIO documentation if specific scopes are required for the API endpoints used by the toolkit.
        *   **Network Connectivity:** Check network connectivity between ELITEA and the TestIO API endpoint. Ensure there are no firewall rules or network issues blocking the connection.
        *   **ELITEA Error Logs:** Examine ELITEA's error logs for any specific error messages related to the TestIO Toolkit integration. These logs can provide more detailed clues about the failure.

2.  **Data Errors or Empty Data Retrieval:**
    *   **Problem:** Integration is successful (no connection errors), but the agent retrieves incorrect data, incomplete data, or empty datasets from TestIO.
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        *   **Verify Product ID and Test Run ID:** Double-check that the `productId` and `testCaseTestId` values being used in agent instructions and tool calls are absolutely correct and correspond to valid, *active* test runs and products in your TestIO project. Incorrect IDs are a common cause of data retrieval issues.
        *   **Test Run Status in TestIO:** Verify that the TestIO test run (specified by `testCaseTestId`) is not archived or in a state where data is no longer accessible via the API.
        *   **Instruction Accuracy:** Review the agent's instructions to ensure they are correctly using the TestIO tools and providing the required parameters (`productId`, `testCaseTestId`, filter parameters if applicable).
        *   **Tool Parameter Requirements:** Re-examine the documentation for each TestIO tool (`Get Test Cases for Test`, `Test Cases Statuses for Test`, `List Bugs for Test with Filter`) to confirm you are providing all *required* parameters and in the correct format.
        *   **Example Instructions and Testing:** Start with the example instruction provided in this guide and test it to ensure basic data retrieval works. Gradually increase complexity as needed.

3.  **Agent Type Compatibility:**
    *   **Problem:** If you are using a specific agent type in ELITEA (beyond a general "OpenAI Agent"), and the TestIO Toolkit is not functioning as expected, consider if there are any agent-type-specific limitations or compatibility issues.
    *   **Troubleshooting Step:** As a general troubleshooting step, especially when initially setting up the integration, **try using "OpenAI Agent" type**. This can help rule out issues related to more specialized agent types. If it works with a basic agent, then investigate if there are specific configurations needed for other agent types.
