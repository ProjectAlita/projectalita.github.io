### Brief Overview of Google Places

Google Places is a powerful location-based service provided by Google that allows applications to access and display information about businesses, landmarks, and points of interest. It offers comprehensive details, including business names, addresses, contact information, user reviews, ratings, and real-time data such as open hours and busy periods. It's designed for applications that need location-based services, and offers features for:

*   **Finding Places:** Search for businesses, points of interest, and other locations based on name, keywords, or geographical coordinates.
*   **Detailed Place Information:** Retrieve rich information about places, including address, phone number, website, opening hours, user reviews, and photos.
*   **Nearby Searches:** Find places that are located within a specified radius of a given location.
*   **Autocomplete Suggestions:** Provide users with intelligent location suggestions as they type.

Integrating Google Places with ELITEA brings these robust location-based capabilities directly into your AI-powered workflows. Your ELITEA Agents can then interact with the Google Places API to automate location-related tasks, enhance application functionalities, and improve user experiences through intelligent automation.

## Google Places Integration with ELITEA

### Agent Creation/Configuration

To integrate Google Places, you'll need to configure it within an ELITEA Agent. You can either create a new Agent or modify an existing one.

1.  **Navigate to Agents:** In ELITEA, go to the **Agents** menu.
2.  **Create or Edit Agent:**
    *   **New Agent:** Click **"+ Agent"** to create a new Agent. Follow the steps to define Agent details like name, description, type, and instructions.
    *   **Existing Agent:** Select the Agent you want to integrate with Google Places and click on its name to edit.
3.  **Access Tools Section:** In the Agent configuration, scroll down to the **"Tools"** section.

### Toolkit Configuration

This section details how to configure the Google Places toolkit within your ELITEA Agent.

1.  **Add Toolkit:** In the "Tools" section, click the **"+" icon**.
2.  **Select Google Places:** Choose **"Google Places"** from the dropdown list of available toolkits. This opens the "New Google Places tool" configuration panel.
3.  **Configure Toolkit Details:** Fill in the following fields:

    *   **Name:** Enter a **Name** for this Google Places toolkit instance. Choose a descriptive name that helps you identify its purpose within your Agent's instructions (e.g., "LocationFinder", "PlacesAPI").
    *   **Description:** Provide a **Description** for the toolkit, clarifying its purpose or the specific type of location information it will access (e.g., "Toolkit to find nearby restaurants").
    *   **Results number (to show):** Specify the **number of results** to return from the Google Places API.
    *   **Api Key:**
        *   Paste the **API Key** you generated in Google Cloud into the "Api Key" field.
        *   **Enhanced Security with Secrets:** For improved security, it's highly recommended to use **"Secret"**. Select **"Secret"** and choose a pre-configured secret from the dropdown. You must first create and securely store your **API Key** as a Secret in ELITEA's [Secrets](../../atform-documentation/menus/settings.md#secrets) feature. Using Secrets prevents hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in the toolkit configuration.

Available tools are:
    *   **Find places:** `find_places` - Allows the Agent to find places based on a search query.
    *   **Find near:** `find_near` - Enables the Agent to find places near a specified location.

5.  **Complete Configuration:** Click the **arrow icon** (at the top right of the toolkit configuration) to save the Google Places toolkit setup and return to the main Agent configuration.
6.  Click **Save** to apply configuration and changes.

### Tool Overview

The Google Places toolkit provides the following tools for your ELITEA Agents:

*   **Find places:** `find_places` - Finds places based on a search query.
*   **Find near:** `find_near` - Finds places near a specified location.

## Instructions and Prompts for Using the Toolkit

To instruct your ELITEA Agent to use the Google Places toolkit, you need to provide clear instructions within the Agent's "Instructions" field. These instructions guide the Agent on *when* and *how* to use the available tools.

### Instruction Creation for OpenAI Agents

When creating instructions for the Google Places toolkit for OpenAI-based Agents, focus on clear, action-oriented language. Break down tasks into simple steps and explicitly state the parameters required for each tool. OpenAI Agents respond best to instructions that are:

*   **Direct and Imperative:** Use action verbs and clear commands (e.g., "Use the 'find_places' tool...", "Find places near...").
*   **Parameter-Focused:** Clearly list each parameter and how the Agent should determine its value.
*   **Context-Aware:** Provide enough context so the Agent understands the overall goal and when to use specific tools within a workflow.

When instructing your Agent to use a Google Places toolkit, use this pattern:
```
1. Identify the goal: [State the objective, e.g., "To find nearby restaurants"].
2. Tool Selection: Use the "[tool_name]" tool.
3. Parameter Specification: Provide the following parameters:
    - Parameter Name 1: <value or description of value>
    - Parameter Name 2: <value or description of value>
    - ...
4. Expected Outcome: [Optionally, describe what should happen after the tool is used].
```

**Example Agent Instructions for Google Places Toolkit Tools:**

*   **Agent Instructions for Finding Places:**

    ```
    1. Goal: To find Italian restaurants in New York City.
    2. Tool: Use the "find_places" tool.
    3. Parameters:
        - Query: "Italian restaurants"
        - Location: "New York City"
    4. Outcome: The Agent will provide a list of Italian restaurants in New York City.
    ```

*   **Agent Instructions for Finding Places Near a Location:**

    ```
    1. Goal: To find coffee shops near Times Square in New York City.
    2. Tool: Use the "find_near" tool.
    3. Parameters:
        - Location: "Times Square, New York City"
        - Query: "coffee shops"
    4. Outcome: The Agent will provide a list of coffee shops near Times Square in New York City.
    ```

### Conversation Starters

Use these conversation starters to interact with your Google Places-integrated Agent.

**1. For Testing and Troubleshooting Connection:**

These starters are designed to verify if the Google Places toolkit is correctly configured and connected to the Google Places API.

*   "Find Italian restaurants in Rome." - *This tests basic connectivity and ability to find places.*
*   "Find coffee shops near the Eiffel Tower in Paris." - *This further tests the 'find near' functionality and location-based searching.*

**2. For General Agent Usage Scenarios:**

These starters demonstrate how to initiate agent execution for common Google Places-related tasks.

*   "I'm looking for a good pizza place near me. Can you find some options?" - *This triggers a `find_near` search based on the user's implied location (which the Agent would need to determine or ask for).*
*   "Find the opening hours for the Louvre Museum in Paris." - *This would require a combination of `find_places` to locate the Louvre and then potentially another call to retrieve details (if the toolkit was expanded to support that).*
*   "What are some popular tourist attractions in Tokyo?" - *This could use the `find_places` tool with a general query.*

These conversation starters provide a starting point for interacting with your Google Places-integrated ELITEA Agent and can be customized further based on your specific use cases and workflows.
