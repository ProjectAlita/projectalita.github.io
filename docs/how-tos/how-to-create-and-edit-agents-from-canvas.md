### Modifying Agent Configuration

Once in edit mode, you can modify any configuration parameters to update your agent settings. The edit interface displays current settings pre-populated, allowing you to make changes to:

- **Instructions**: Modify the agent's behavior guidelines and task definitions
- **Welcome Message**: Change the initial message users see
- **Conversation Starters**: Add, remove, or modify starter prompts (maximum 4)
- **Advanced Settings**: Adjust step limits and other parameters
- **LLM Model and Settings**: Switch models or fine-tune model parameters (temperature, top-p, max tokens)
- **Toolkits and Integrations**: Add or remove toolkits, MCP connections, nested agents, and pipelines

For example, if you have an agent configured for code review, you can easily update the **Instructions** to include new coding standards, add additional **Toolkits** like Jira for issue tracking integration, Select another **LLM Model** and update **Model Settings**

 Changes are reflected immediately in the interface. After making your desired configuration changes, use the **Save** button located in the top right corner to apply your modifications. The updated configuration becomes immediately applied.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Agent Creation Issues

**Missing Required Fields:**

- **Problem:** Save button remains disabled
- **Solution:** Review all fields marked with asterisk (*) and ensure they are completed
- **Verification:** Check that both Name and Description fields contain valid text

**Model Configuration Errors:**

- **Problem:** Agent creation fails due to model configuration issues
- **Solution:** Verify that a valid LLM model is selected and model settings are within acceptable ranges
- **Prevention:** Use default model settings initially, then customize as needed


### Agent Management Issues

**Edit Mode Access:**

- **Problem:** Cannot access edit mode for existing agent
- **Solution:** Verify you have appropriate permissions and the agent is not currently in use by other team members
- **Workaround:** Ensure no active operations are using the agent

**Configuration Validation:**

- **Problem:** Changes cannot be saved due to validation errors
- **Solution:** Review error messages and ensure all required fields maintain valid values
- **Resolution:** Check that external resources (models, toolkits) are still accessible

### PARTICIPANTS Section Issues

**Agent Not Appearing:**

- **Problem:** Created agent doesn't appear in PARTICIPANTS
- **Solution:** Refresh the interface or verify the agent was created in the correct workspace/project
- **Check:** Ensure you're viewing the correct project context

**Model Settings Not Applying:**

- **Problem:** Model configuration changes don't take effect
- **Solution:** Ensure you clicked "Apply" in the model settings dialog before closing
- **Prevention:** Always use the Apply button rather than just closing the settings dialog
