**Understanding Project Scopes:**

*   **Private Workspace:** Your personal and private area within ELITEA to create and manage your Entities and Collections. Only you have access to your **Private** workspace.
*   **Team Projects:** Collaborative spaces for teams to work together on projects, sharing and managing Entities and Collections. Access to Team projects is controlled by project roles and permissions.
*   **Public Project:** A shared, community space within ELITEA where published Prompts and Collections are available for all users to discover and utilize.

## Importance of Organizing Entities in ELITEA

As you build and utilize more Entities within ELITEA, effective organization becomes paramount. Without a robust organizational system, managing a growing number of entities can become challenging, leading to:

*   **Difficulty in Finding Entities:** Spending excessive time searching for the right Prompt, Datasource, or Agent among a long, unorganized list.
*   **Reduced Efficiency:** Slower workflows and decreased productivity due to the time wasted on searching and managing entities.
*   **Inconsistent Naming and Duplication:** Lack of a clear organizational structure can lead to inconsistent naming conventions and accidental duplication of entities, creating clutter and confusion.
*   **Hindered Collaboration:** Sharing and collaborating on entities becomes difficult when they are not properly categorized and grouped, hindering team efficiency and knowledge sharing.

**Tags** and **Collections** in ELITEA directly address these challenges by providing intuitive and flexible ways to categorize, group, and manage your AI artifacts, ensuring you can quickly find, utilize, and share the resources you need, when you need them.

## Overview of Tags

In ELITEA, **Tags** are your essential tool for categorizing and labeling individual Entities. Think of tags as keywords or labels that you attach to each Entity, allowing you to create a flexible and searchable organizational system. Tags are designed to:

*   **Categorize Entities:** Assign Entities to relevant categories based on topic, function, project, team, or any other criteria that makes sense for your workflow.
*   **Improve Searchability:** Make it easy to find specific Entities by filtering and searching based on assigned tags.
*   **Enable Flexible Grouping:** Group Entities based on multiple criteria by assigning multiple tags to each item.

**Configuring Tags for Entities:**

1.  **Access Entity Configuration:** Open the configuration settings for the Entity you want to tag.
2.  **Locate "Tags" Input Box:** Within the **Configuration** tab, find the **Tags** input box.
3.  **Add Tags:**
    *   **Type a Tag Name:** Begin typing the desired tag name.
    *   **Select or Create:** Select a suggested tag or create a new one by pressing **Enter**.
4.  **Save Configuration:** Click the **Save** button to save the Entity with the selected tags.

**Note on 'code' Tag:**

The tag named `code` is reserved for integration with the Alita Code extension. If you create and assign the tag `code` to Prompts, Agents, or Datasources within your ELITEA project, it enables a special synchronization feature.

**Functionality of the `code` Tag:**

* **Alita Code Extension Connection**: When you set up the Alita Code extension and connect it to your ELITEA project, the extension will recognize and utilize Entities that are tagged with code.
* **Synchronization and Usage in Code Editor**: Entities tagged with code become accessible and usable directly within your IDE through the Alita Code extension. This allows you to seamlessly integrate your ELITEA-managed AI artifacts into your local coding workflows.

**Key Features of Tags:**

*   **Multi-Dimensional Labeling:** Assign multiple tags to each Entity for flexible categorization.
*   **Free-Form Text:** Create custom tags relevant to your specific needs.
*   **Searchable and Filterable:** Easily locate Entities using tag-based search and filtering.
*   **Visual Identification:** Tags are displayed as labels for quick identification.

**Searching and Filtering Entities by Tags:**

*   **Search by Tags:** Use the **Search** bar in any Entity menu (Prompts, Datasources, Agents) and type a tag name to filter the list.
*   **Filter by Tags:** Use the **Tags"** section in entity menus to select tags and narrow down the displayed list.

![Collection-Publishing](../img/how-tos/collections/Collection-Publishing.png)

**Important Notes on Publishing Collections:**

*   **Minimum Requirement - Published Entity:** **A Collection cannot be published unless it contains at least one *already published* Entity (Prompt, Datasource, or Agent).** Ensure that your collection includes at least one published entity before attempting to publish the collection itself.
*   **Separate Entity Publication is Necessary:** **Publishing a Collection does *not* automatically publish the individual entities (Prompts, Datasources, Agents) contained within it.**  If you intend to include specific entities in your published Collection in the Public project, you must **publish each of those entities *separately*** in their respective menus (Prompts, Datasources, Agents) *before* publishing the Collection.
*   **Collection Duplication in Public Project:** Publishing a Collection essentially **creates a *duplicate* of your Collection in the Public project.** This published copy will include all the *already published* entities that were part of your original Collection at the time of publishing.  Changes made to the original Collection in your Private or Team project *after* publishing will **not** automatically be reflected in the published Collection in the **Public** project.
*   **Currently Supported Entity Type for Public Collections - Prompts:**  **Currently, publishing Collections primarily focuses on sharing *Prompts* within the collection to the Public project.** While Collections can contain Datasources and Agents, the publishing mechanism for Collections is primarily designed for sharing groups of Prompts within the community.  Functionality for publishing Collections with Datasources and Agents will be expanded in future updates.

**Deleting a Collection:**

1.  **Open Collections Menu:** Navigate to the Collections menu.
2.  **Locate Collection:** Find the collection you want to delete.
3.  **Delete Collection:** Click the **Delete** icon.
4.  **Confirmation:** Confirm the deletion when prompted.

**Exporting Collections:**

1.  **Open Collection Detail View:** Navigate to the Collections menu and open the collection you want to export.
2.  **Export Collection:** Click the **Export Collection** icon.
3.  **Download JSON File:** A JSON file containing the collection data will be downloaded.

**Importing Collections:**

1.  **Import Collection:** Click the **Import** button in the Collections menu.
2.  **Select Collection File:** In the "Import Wizard," select the **JSON file** from your device.
3.  **Configure Import Options:** Choose the target project and select Entities to import.
4.  **Start Import:** Click the **"Import"** button.
5.  **Locate Imported Entities:** Find imported Entities in their respective menus (Prompts, Datasources, Agents).

**Important Note on Collection Entity Recreation:** The Collection entity itself is not automatically recreated during import.
