!!! info "Primary Interface"
    All indexing operations are performed via the **Indexes Tab Interface**. This dedicated interface provides comprehensive index management with visual status indicators, real-time progress monitoring, and integrated search capabilities.

!!! warning "Requirements"
    Before proceeding, ensure your project has PgVector and Embedding Model configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration, and your TestRail toolkit has the **Index Data** tool enabled.

### Step 1: Access the Interface

1. **Navigate to Toolkits**: Go to **Toolkits** in the main navigation
2. **Select Your TestRail Toolkit**: Choose your configured TestRail toolkit from the list
3. **Open Indexes Tab**: Click on the **Indexes** tab in the toolkit detail view

If the tab is disabled or not visible, verify that:
- PgVector and Embedding Model are configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
- The **Index Data** tool is enabled in your toolkit configuration

### Step 2: Create a New Index

1. **Click Create New Index**: In the Indexes sidebar, click the **+ Create New Index** button
2. **New Index Form**: The center panel displays the new index creation form

### Step 3: Configure Index Parameters

Fill in the required and optional parameters for your TestRail indexing:

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example Value |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Index Name | ‚úì | Suffix for collection name (max 7 chars) | `cases` or `qa` |
| Clean Index | ‚úó | Remove existing index data before re-indexing | ‚úì (checked) or ‚úó (unchecked) |
| Progress Step (0 - 100) | ‚úó | Step size for progress reporting during indexing | `10` (default) |
| Chunking Config | ‚úó | Configuration settings for content chunking | `{"chunk_size": 4000, "chunk_overlap": 200}` |
| Chunking Tool | ‚úó | Method for splitting content into chunks | `json` (default) |
| project_id | ‚úì | TestRail project ID to index data from | `1` or `5` |
| suite_id | ‚úó | Optional TestRail suite ID to filter test cases | `3` or leave empty |

| include_attachments | ‚úó | Whether to include attachment content in indexing | ‚úì (checked) or ‚úó (unchecked) |
| skip_attachment_extensions | ‚úó | File extensions to skip when processing attachments | `[".png", ".jpg"]` |

### Step 4: Start Indexing

1. **Form Validation**: The **Index** button remains inactive until all required fields are filled
2. **Review Configuration**: Verify all parameters are correct
3. **Click Index Button**: Start the indexing process
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time updates with visual indicators:
      - üîÑ **In Progress**: Indexing is currently running
      - ‚úÖ **Completed**: Indexing finished successfully
      - ‚ùå **Failed**: Indexing encountered an error

![Indexing](../../img/how-tos/indexing/testrail/testrail-index-tab.png)

!!! info "Alternative: Test Settings Method"
    For quick testing and validation, you can also use the **Test Settings** panel on the right side of the toolkit detail page. Select a model, choose the **Index Data** tool from the dropdown, configure parameters, and click **Run Tool**. However, the Indexes Tab Interface is the recommended approach for comprehensive index management.

### Step 5: Verify Index Creation

After indexing completes, verify the index was created successfully:

1. **Check Index Status**: Visual indicators show completion status
2. **Review Index Details**: Click on the created index to see metadata and document count
3. **Test Search**: Use the **Run** tab to test search functionality with sample queries

!!! warning "Toolkit Name Dependency"
    **Indexes are tied to toolkit names**. If you rename or delete a toolkit, all associated indexes will become inaccessible and appear to be lost. However, if you restore the original toolkit name or create a new toolkit with the same name, all previously created indexes will automatically become visible and accessible again. Plan toolkit names carefully to avoid unintended data access issues.

### Real-Life Example: Indexing QA Test Documentation

**Scenario**: You have a QA team with comprehensive test documentation in TestRail for an e-commerce web application. You want to make all test cases, procedures, and testing knowledge searchable for team collaboration and knowledge sharing.

**Indexing Steps:**

1. **Configure TestRail Toolkit:**
     - URL: `https://yourcompany.testrail.io/`
     - Email: `qa.manager@yourcompany.com`
     - API Key: Generated from TestRail ‚Üí My Settings ‚Üí API Keys

2. **Index Complete E-commerce Project:**
     - Project ID: `1`
     - Collection suffix: `ecom`
     - Progress Step: `5` (report every 5 test cases)
     - Clean Index: ‚úì (for fresh start)
     - Include Attachments: ‚úì (for test screenshots and documentation)
     - Skip Attachment Extensions: `[".jpg"]`
     - Chunking Tool: `json`
     - Chunking Config: Default

   ![TestRail Index Configuration](../../img/how-tos/indexing/testrail/testrail-index-toolkit.png)

3. **Index Specific Test Suite (Optional):**
     - Project ID: `1`
     - Suite ID: `10` (only User Authentication Tests)
     - Collection suffix: `auth`
     - Include Attachments: ‚úó (authentication tests rarely have attachments)

4. **Index Specific Section (Optional):**
     - Project ID: `1`
     - Suite ID: `20`
     - Section ID: `203` (only Checkout Process tests)
     - Collection suffix: `checkout`
     - Include Attachments: ‚úì (checkout tests often have payment screenshots)

5. **Verify indexing:**
     - Use "List Collections" tool to confirm collections exist
     - Expected collections: `ecom`, `auth`, `checkout`
     - Check indexing output for test case processing confirmation

     ![TestRail List Collections](../../img/how-tos/indexing/testrail/testrail-collections.png)

## Best Practices

### Test Documentation Organization

- **Use descriptive project names** that reflect the application or feature being tested
- **Organize test cases by functionality** for better search results and coverage analysis
- **Include clear test steps and expected results** to improve indexing quality and searchability

### Indexing Strategy

- **Use clear collection suffixes** to separate different test projects (e.g., `web`, `mobile`, `api`)
- **Clean index periodically** when test documentation changes significantly
- **Include attachments** when test cases contain important screenshots or documentation files

### Search Optimization

- **Use natural language queries** rather than specific test case IDs
- **Be specific about testing areas** for better results (e.g., "authentication tests" vs "login")
- **Try different search tools** for various use cases:
    - Basic questions: Search Index
    - Complex analysis: Stepback Search Index
    - Test planning: Stepback Summary Index

### Content Management

- **Update indexes** when adding significant new test cases or projects
- **Remove outdated collections** using the Remove Index tool
- **Maintain test case organization** in TestRail for better indexing results
