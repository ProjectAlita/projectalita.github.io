# Index Figma Data

!!! warning "Availability"
    Indexing tools are available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) (Release 1.7.0) and replace legacy Datasources/Datasets. For context, see [Release Notes 1.7.0](../../release-notes/rn_current.md#indexing-tools-replacement-for-datasets) and the [Indexing Overview](./indexing-overview.md).

This guide provides a complete step-by-step walkthrough for indexing Figma data and then searching or chatting with the indexed content using ELITEA's AI-powered tools.

## Overview

Figma indexing allows you to create searchable indexes from your Figma design collaboration and UI/UX content:

- **Design Files**: Complete Figma files with all design elements, components, and layouts
- **Frames & Pages**: Individual screens, artboards, and design layouts within files
- **Components & Instances**: Reusable design components and their instances across projects
- **Design Elements**: UI elements like buttons, forms, icons, and interactive components
- **Project Organization**: Team projects, file structures, and design system hierarchies

**What you can do with indexed Figma data:**

- **Design Search**: Find specific design patterns, components, or screens across your design system
- **Context-Aware Design Chat**: Get AI-generated answers about design decisions and patterns with references to specific files
- **Cross-Project Discovery**: Search for design elements and patterns across multiple Figma projects
- **Design System Analysis**: Analyze component usage, design consistency, and UI patterns
- **Component Documentation**: Extract insights about design components and their usage patterns

**Common use cases:**

- Finding specific design components or patterns across your design system for reuse
- Onboarding new designers by allowing them to ask questions about design standards and components
- Analyzing design consistency and identifying opportunities for component standardization
- Product teams searching for specific UI patterns and design decisions
- Design system managers extracting insights about component adoption and usage

## Finding Required Figma IDs

Before indexing, you'll need to identify the specific Figma resources you want to index. Here's how to find the required IDs:

### Project ID

For tools that require a **Project ID**, you can obtain it in the following ways:

1. **From Project URL (If You Are Project Admin) - Web & Desktop:**
   
    * **Web:** Extract from project URL: `https://www.figma.com/files/project/[PROJECT_ID]/[PROJECT_NAME]`
   
    * **Desktop:** Use **File → Show in browser** or **Share** → copy project link, then extract from project URL

2. **Request from Project Administrator:** If you don't have admin access to the project, contact the project administrator or team owner to provide you with the **Project ID**.

  ![Figma Project Id](../../img/how-tos/indexing/figma/figma-projectid.png) 

!!! info "Project ID Usage Note"
    Providing Project ID for indexing is optional. It's generally better to use **File Keys** for targeted indexing instead, because projects may contain many files which could result in large indexes. Use Project ID only when you specifically need to index all files in a project or create comprehensive project-level indexes.

### File Key  

* **Web:** Extract from file URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/[FILE_KEY]/[FILE_NAME]`
* **Desktop:** Use **File → Copy link** or **Share** button, then extract from URL 

  ![Figma File key](../../img/how-tos/indexing/figma/figm-file-key.png) 

### Node IDs

* **Web:** Right-click any design element → **Copy link** → extract from URL parameter `node-id=[NODE_ID]`
* **Desktop:** Right-click element → **Copy link** or select multiple elements (Ctrl/Cmd) → **Copy link**, then extract from URL

  ![Figma Node Id](../../img/how-tos/indexing/figma/figma-node-id.png) 

!!! tip "ID Format"
    - **Project ID**: Numeric (e.g., `123456789`)
    - **File Key**: Alphanumeric string (e.g., `ABC123DEF456`)  
    - **Node ID**: Colon-separated format (e.g., `123:456`)

!!! info "Detailed ID Finding Instructions"
    For comprehensive step-by-step instructions including additional methods and troubleshooting tips, see the [Figma Key Parameters](../../integrations/toolkits/figma_toolkit.md#figma-key-parameters) section in the Figma Integration Guide.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Errors and Solutions

**"Indexes tab not visible" or "Tab disabled":**

- Verify PgVector and Embedding Model are configured in Settings → AI Configuration
- Ensure the **Index Data** tool is enabled in your Figma toolkit configuration
- Check that your toolkit supports indexing (Figma is supported)
- Refresh the browser page and retry

**"+ Create New Index button not working":**

- Verify all project-level prerequisites are met (PgVector and Embedding Model)
- Check that you have proper permissions for the toolkit
- Ensure the toolkit is properly saved with credentials

**"Authentication failed" or "Unauthorized access":**

  - Verify your Figma credential has the correct Personal Access Token (starts with `figd_`)
  - Ensure your token has not expired in your Figma account settings
  - Check that your Figma account has access to the projects and files you want to index
  - Verify the token was copied correctly without extra spaces or characters

**"No files found" or "Project not accessible":**

  - Verify the Project ID is correct and accessible to your Figma account
  - Ensure your account has permission to view the specific project and its files
  - Check that the project exists and has not been deleted or archived
  - Confirm your token's associated account is a member of the team that owns the project

**"File keys not found" or "Invalid file keys":**

  - Check that the file keys are copied correctly from Figma URLs (case-sensitive)
  - Ensure the files exist and are accessible to your account
  - Verify file sharing settings allow API access if using publicly shared files
  - Try indexing with Project ID instead of specific file keys for broader access

**"Vector database connection failed" or "PgVector errors":**

  - Ensure PgVector is properly configured in Settings → AI Configuration
  - Verify the vector database is running and accessible
  - Check connection credentials and database permissions
  - Restart the vector database service if connection issues persist

**"No design elements indexed" or "Empty results":**

  - Check that Node Types filters are not excluding all content
  - Verify the Figma files contain the specified node types (FRAME, COMPONENT, etc.)
  - Try indexing without node type filters first, then add restrictions
  - Ensure the design files have proper structure and named elements

### Performance and Scope Considerations

**For Large Design Projects:**

- Use specific file filters: `File Keys Include` for targeted indexing
- Filter by node types: include only `["FRAME", "COMPONENT"]` for key design elements
- Set reasonable progress steps: start with 25 for large projects
- Consider indexing by project phase: current designs vs. archived files

### Search Result Quality

**If search returns few/no results:**

- Lower the cut-off score from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3
- Increase search_top from 10 to 20 or 30
- Try rephrasing your query with design-specific terms (component names, screen types)
- Verify the indexed content contains relevant design information for your query

**For better search quality:**

- Include both frames and components for comprehensive coverage
- Use natural language queries rather than exact file names
- Leverage stepback search for complex design questions that require reasoning
- Create separate indexes for different design types (mobile vs. web, current vs. archived)

### Content-Specific Indexing Tips

**For Design Systems:**

- Focus on components: include `["COMPONENT", "COMPONENT_SET"]` node types
- Index component libraries and design tokens for comprehensive coverage
- Include both current and deprecated components for historical context

**For Product Design:**

- Include frames and screens: `["FRAME"]` for screen-level designs
- Index across multiple product areas for cross-feature insights
- Consider including prototyping and interaction states

**For UI/UX Research:**

- Include wireframes and user flow designs
- Index research artifacts and design explorations
- Focus on user-centered design elements and patterns
