# Index Confluence Data

!!! warning "Availability"
    Indexing tools are available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) (Release 1.7.0) and replace legacy Datasources/Datasets. For context, see [Release Notes 1.7.0](../../release-notes/rn_current.md#indexing-tools-replacement-for-datasets) and the [Indexing Overview](./indexing-overview.md).

This guide provides a complete step-by-step walkthrough for indexing Confluence data and then searching or chatting with the indexed content using ELITEA's AI-powered tools.

!!! info "Primary Interface"
    Indexing operations are performed through the **Indexes** interface within Toolkit Configuration. This interface provides comprehensive index management with visual status indicators, real-time progress monitoring, and integrated search capabilities. For detailed information, see [How to create and use indexes](./using-indexes-tab-interface.md).

## Overview

Confluence indexing allows you to create searchable indexes from your Confluence knowledge base content:

- **Pages & Documentation**: Meeting notes, project documentation, how-to guides, and knowledge articles
- **Spaces**: Organized content collections for teams, projects, or departments
- **Labels & Metadata**: Content categorization and tagging systems
- **Attachments**: Document files, images, and other media attached to pages
- **Comments**: User discussions and collaborative input on pages

**What you can do with indexed Confluence data:**

- **Semantic Search**: Find information across your Confluence spaces using natural language queries
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Get AI-generated answers from your knowledge base with citations
- **Cross-Space Discovery**: Search across multiple Confluence spaces and projects
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Transform Confluence content into searchable organizational knowledge
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze patterns, gaps, and relationships in your documentation

**Common use cases:**

- Onboarding new team members by allowing them to ask questions about processes and documentation
- Finding specific procedures, policies, or best practices across your knowledge base
- Generating summaries or explanations from existing documentation
- Support ticket resolution using indexed knowledge articles and FAQ content
- Content audit and analysis to identify documentation gaps or outdated information

## Search and Chat with Indexed Data

Once your Confluence data is indexed, you can use the toolkit to search and interact with your content in multiple ways:

### Using Toolkit in Conversations and Agents

Your Confluence toolkit can be used in two main contexts:

1. **In Conversations**: Add the toolkit as a participant to ask questions and search your indexed Confluence data
2. **In Agents**: Include the toolkit when creating AI agents to give them access to your Confluence knowledge base

**How to use:**

- **Start a New Conversation or Create an Agent**
- **Add Toolkit as Participant**: Select your Confluence toolkit from the available toolkits
- **Ask Natural Language Questions**: The toolkit will automatically search your indexed data and provide relevant answers with citations

### Real-Life Example Workflow

Let's walk through a complete example of indexing and using a company knowledge base:

**Step 1: Setup Confluence Toolkit for Company Knowledge Base**

 **Configure Confluence Toolkit:**

   - Base URL: `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki`
   - Space: `KB` (Knowledge Base space key)
   - Hosting Option: `Cloud`
   - Credential: Your Confluence API token
   - Tools enabled: `Index Data`, `List Collections`, `Search Index`, `Stepback Search Index`, `Stepback Summary Index`, `Remove Index`


**Step 2: Use in Conversations**

 **Add toolkit to a conversation and start asking questions:**

   - Navigate to **Conversations** ‚Üí **+ New Conversation**
   - In the participants section click + to add Toolkit
   - Select your Confluence toolkit from the available toolkits list

**Step 3: Index the Knowledge Base**

 * **User Request in Chat:**
 
   > "Index our knowledge base with collection suffix 'kb'. Include attachments and labels but exclude comments. Keep markdown formatting and clean any existing index first."

![Confluence Index Configuration](../../img/how-tos/indexing/confluence/confluence-index.png)
 

**Step 4: Verify Index Creation**

 * **User Request:**
 
   > "List my collections"

 **Confluence Toolkit Response:**

 ![Confluence list collections](../../img/how-tos/indexing/confluence/confluence-list.png)

 This confirms the indexing completed successfully and your knowledge base collection is available for searching.

**Step 5: Start the conversation and begin asking questions about your indexed content**

  * **User Request:** "What is our company's vacation policy?"
   
  * **Confluence Toolkit:** "Based on your indexed knowledge base, here's your company's vacation policy:
   
    1. **Annual Leave Entitlement**: All full-time employees are entitled to 25 days of annual leave per year
    2. **Accrual System**: Vacation days accrue monthly at a rate of 2.08 days per month
    3. **Carryover Policy**: Up to 5 unused vacation days can be carried over to the next year...
   
   *Source: HR Policies ‚Üí Employee Benefits ‚Üí Vacation Policy (Page ID: 12345)*"

   ![Confluence Search](../../img/how-tos/indexing/confluence/confluence-search.png)
   
   * **User Request:** "How do I set up a new development environment?"
   
   * **Confluence Toolkit:** "Here's the step-by-step process for setting up a new development environment:
   
     **Prerequisites:**

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Indexing interface not visible" or "Tab disabled":**

- Verify PgVector and Embedding Model are configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
- Ensure the **Index Data** tool is enabled in your Confluence toolkit configuration
- Check that your toolkit supports indexing (Confluence is supported)
- Refresh the browser page and retry

**"+ Create New Index button not working":**

- Verify all project-level prerequisites are met (PgVector and Embedding Model)
- Check that you have proper permissions for the toolkit
- Ensure the toolkit is properly saved with credentials

### Common Errors and Solutions

**"Space not found" or "Authentication failed":**

  - Verify your Confluence credential has the correct API token
  - Ensure the space key is exact and case-sensitive (e.g., `KB`, not `kb`)
  - Check that your token has appropriate permissions for the space

**"Index creation failed" or "Indexing stuck in progress":**

- Check your space and filter configurations aren't too restrictive
- Verify the space contains pages matching your criteria
- Monitor the progress indicators for specific error messages

**"API rate limit exceeded":**

  - Large spaces may hit Confluence API limits
  - Reduce Max Pages or use more specific filtering (labels, CQL)
  - Wait and retry, or consider indexing in smaller batches

**"No documents indexed":**

  - Check your label or CQL filters aren't too restrictive
  - Verify the space contains pages matching your criteria
  - Try indexing without filters first, then add restrictions

**"No search results returned":**

- Verify the index shows ‚úÖ **Completed** status
- Check that your search query matches the type of content indexed
- Try broader search terms or different search tools (Stepback Search, Stepback Summary)
- Ensure the indexed content contains relevant information

**"Vector database connection failed" or "PgVector errors":**

  - Ensure PgVector is properly configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
  - Verify the vector database is running and accessible
  - Check connection credentials and database permissions
  - Restart the vector database service if connection issues persist

**"Embedding model not found" or "Embedding errors":**

  - Verify an embedding model is selected in AI Configuration
  - Check if the embedding model is properly downloaded/initialized
  - Try switching to a different embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002)
  - Ensure sufficient system resources for the embedding model to load

### Performance and Scope Considerations

**For Large Confluence Spaces:**

- Use specific label filters: `label="documentation"` or `label="public"`
- Use CQL queries to target specific content: `space="KB" AND created>="2024-01-01"`
- Consider indexing by space hierarchy: index parent pages first, then children
- Monitor the progress indicators and document count during indexing

### Search Result Quality

**If search returns few/no results:**

- Verify the index shows ‚úÖ **Completed** status in the sidebar
- Lower the cut-off score from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3
- Increase search_top from 10 to 20 or 30
- Try rephrasing your query with different keywords
- Verify the indexed content contains relevant information for your query

**For better search quality:**

- Include both pages and attachments for comprehensive coverage
- Use natural language queries rather than exact keyword matches
- Leverage the integrated chat interface for follow-up questions
- Create separate indexes for different content types (public vs internal, different spaces)

### Content-Specific Indexing Tips

**For Knowledge Base Content:**

- Focus on pages with `public` or `documentation` labels
- Include attachments for comprehensive policy and procedure documents
- Consider excluding comments unless they contain valuable information

**For Project Documentation:**

- Use space-specific indexing for better organization
- Include both current and archived content for historical context
- Index meeting notes and project updates separately from technical documentation

**For Troubleshooting Guides:**

- Include pages with labels like `troubleshooting`, `faq`, or `support`
- Index both internal and customer-facing content
- Consider including comments as they often contain additional solutions
