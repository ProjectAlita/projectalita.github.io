# Index Jira Data

!!! warning "Availability"
    Indexing tools are available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) (Release 1.7.0) and replace legacy Datasources/Datasets. For context, see [Release Notes 1.7.0](../../release-notes/rn_current.md#indexing-tools-replacement-for-datasets) and the [Indexing Overview](./indexing-overview.md).

This guide provides a complete step-by-step walkthrough for indexing Jira data and then searching or chatting with the indexed content using ELITEA's AI-powered tools.

## Overview

Jira indexing allows you to create searchable indexes from your Jira project management content:

- **Issues & Stories**: User stories, bugs, tasks, epics, and sub-tasks with full descriptions
- **Custom Fields**: Project-specific fields, custom workflows, and metadata
- **Attachments**: Screenshots, documents, test files, and other media attached to issues
- **Comments**: Discussion threads, status updates, and collaborative input on issues
- **Project Data**: Sprint information, priorities, assignees, and project hierarchies

**What you can do with indexed Jira data:**

- **Semantic Search**: Find issues, bugs, and stories across projects using natural language queries
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Get AI-generated answers from your project data with citations to specific issues
- **Cross-Project Discovery**: Search across multiple Jira projects and issue types
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Transform Jira content into searchable organizational knowledge
- **Project Analysis**: Analyze patterns, trends, and relationships in your project management data

**Common use cases:**

- Finding similar bugs or issues across projects for faster resolution
- Onboarding new team members by allowing them to ask questions about project history and processes
- Analyzing sprint retrospectives and team feedback for continuous improvement
- Support and customer service teams searching for known issues and solutions
- Project managers extracting insights from historical project data and decisions

2. **In Agents**: Include the toolkit when creating AI agents to give them access to your Jira project data

**How to use:**

- **Start a New Conversation or Create an Agent**
- **Add Toolkit as Participant**: Select your Jira toolkit from the available toolkits
- **Ask Natural Language Questions**: The toolkit will automatically search your indexed data and provide relevant answers with citations

### Real-Life Example Workflow

Let's walk through a complete example of indexing and using a software project's Jira data:

**Step 1: Setup Jira Toolkit for Software Project**

**Step 2: Use in Conversations**

 **Add toolkit to a conversation and start asking questions:**

   - Navigate to **Conversations** ‚Üí **+ New Conversation**
   - In the participants section click + to add Toolkit
   - Select your Jira toolkit from the available toolkits list

**Step 3: Index the Project Issues**

 * **User Request in Chat:**
 
     > "Index all issues from project EL with suffix 'issues'. Include comments but skip attachments and image files. Clean any existing index first."

   ![Jira List](../../img/how-tos/indexing/jira/Jira-index-chat.png)


**Step 4: Verify Index Creation**

 * **User Request in Chat:**
 
     > "List my collections"


 * **Jira Toolkit Response:**

![Jira List](../../img/how-tos/indexing/jira/jira-list-collections.png)

 This confirms the indexing completed successfully and your project collection is available for searching.

**Step 5: Start the conversation and begin asking questions about your indexed content**

  * **User:** "What are the most common login bugs we've encountered?"
   
  * **Jira Toolkit:** "Based on your indexed project data, here are the most common login bugs:
   
    1. **Session Timeout Issues**: Multiple reports of users being logged out unexpectedly (EL-234, EL-287, EL-301)
    2. **Password Reset Failures**: Email delivery issues preventing password resets (EL-156, EL-189)
    3. **Two-Factor Authentication Problems**: Users unable to complete 2FA setup (CALC-EL, CALC-EL)
   
   *Sources: CALC-234 (Priority: High), CALC-287 (Status: Resolved), CALC-301 (Assignee: john.doe)*"

   ![Jira Search](../../img/how-tos/indexing/jira/jira-index-search.png)
   
  * **User:** "Retrieve from my collection tests related to profile setup"
   
  * **Jira Toolkit:** "Here are the tests related to profile setup from your indexed data:
   
    **Test Cases Found:**
     1. **User Profile Creation Test**: Verify new user can create complete profile (CALC-445)
     2. **Profile Validation Test**: Test profile field validation and error handling (CALC-446)
     3. **Profile Picture Upload Test**: Test image upload functionality in user profiles (CALC-447)
   
    **Setup Requirements:**
     1. Test user accounts with different permission levels
     2. Valid and invalid profile data sets
     3. Image files for upload testing (various formats and sizes)
   
   *Sources: CALC-445 (Test: Profile Creation), CALC-446 (Test: Validation), CALC-447 (Test: Image Upload)*"

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Errors and Solutions

**"Indexes tab not visible" or "Tab disabled":**

- Verify PgVector and Embedding Model are configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
- Ensure the **Index Data** tool is enabled in your Jira toolkit configuration
- Check that your toolkit supports indexing (Jira is supported)
- Refresh the browser page and retry

**"+ Create New Index button not working":**

- Verify all project-level prerequisites are met (PgVector and Embedding Model)
- Check that you have proper permissions for the toolkit
- Ensure the toolkit is properly saved with credentials

**"Authentication failed" or "Unauthorized access":**

  - Verify your Jira credential has the correct API token
  - Ensure your token has appropriate permissions for the projects you want to index
  - Check that your token hasn't expired in your Atlassian account settings

**"JQL query syntax error":**

  - Verify your JQL syntax is correct using Jira's query builder
  - Common examples: `project=PROJ`, `status IN (Open, Resolved)`, `updated >= -4w`
  - Test your JQL query directly in Jira before using it for indexing

**"No issues indexed" or "Empty result set":**

  - Check your JQL filter isn't too restrictive
  - Verify the project key is correct and case-sensitive
  - Try indexing without JQL filter first, then add restrictions
  - Ensure your account has permission to view the specified projects

**"Vector database connection failed" or "PgVector errors":**

  - Ensure PgVector is properly configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
  - Verify the vector database is running and accessible
  - Check connection credentials and database permissions
  - Restart the vector database service if connection issues persist

**"Attachment processing errors":**

  - Large attachments may cause timeouts; consider using Skip Attachment Extensions
  - Binary files (executables, videos) should be excluded via Skip Attachment Extensions
  - Check available storage space for the vector database

### Performance and Scope Considerations

**For Large Jira Projects:**

- Use specific JQL filters: `project=PROJ AND updated >= -12w` (last 12 weeks)
- Filter by issue type: `project=PROJ AND issuetype IN (Bug, Story)`
- Set reasonable Max Total Issues limits: start with 500-1000 issues for testing
- Consider indexing by project phases: current sprint, recent releases, archived items

### Search Result Quality

**If search returns few/no results:**

- Lower the cut-off score from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3
- Increase search_top from 10 to 20 or 30
- Try rephrasing your query with Jira-specific terms (issue keys, component names)
- Verify the indexed content contains relevant information for your query

**For better search quality:**

- Include both issue descriptions and attachments for comprehensive coverage
- Use natural language queries rather than exact Jira field names
- Leverage stepback search for complex project questions that require reasoning
- Create separate indexes for different project types (development vs support, current vs archived)

### Content-Specific Indexing Tips

**For Software Development Projects:**

- Focus on bugs and stories: `issuetype IN (Bug, Story, Task)`
- Include recent issues: `updated >= -13w` (last quarter)
- Index both current and resolved issues for historical context

**For Support and Helpdesk:**

- Include all issue types for comprehensive ticket history
- Focus on resolved issues with solutions: `status=Resolved AND resolution!=Duplicate`
- Consider including comments as they often contain valuable troubleshooting steps

**For Project Management:**

- Include epics and high-level planning issues: `issuetype IN (Epic, Initiative)`
- Index across multiple projects for portfolio-level insights
- Include both active and completed projects for lessons learned
