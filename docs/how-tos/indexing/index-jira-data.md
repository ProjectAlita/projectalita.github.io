!!! info "Guide in progress"
    This guide is being finalized for the Next environment. A complete step-by-step with field names and screenshots is coming soon.

Until then, you can:

- Configure the Jira Toolkit and assign a valid credential: see the [Jira Toolkit](../../integrations/toolkits/jira_toolkit.md) and [Create a Credential](../../getting-started/create-credential.md).
- Use the toolkitâ€™s Test section to run the "Index Data" tool and create an index.
- Review the general flow in the [Next Environment Quick Start](../../getting-started/next-quick-start.md#index-data-for-a-toolkit).
- Need help? See [How to Contact ELITEA Support](../../support/contact-support.md).
