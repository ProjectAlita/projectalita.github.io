# Index SharePoint Data

!!! warning "Availability"
    Indexing tools are available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) (Release 1.7.0) and replace legacy Datasources/Datasets. For context, see [Release Notes 1.7.0](../../release-notes/rn_current.md#indexing-tools-replacement-for-datasets) and the [Indexing Overview](./indexing-overview.md).

!!! info "Migration from Datasources"
    In previous releases, there was a **Source type: File** option in Datasources. Now, Datasources have been removed from ELITEA, and users can perform the same action through SharePoint Toolkit indexing.
    
    **How to migrate from Datasources to SharePoint Toolkit:**
    
    1. **Add files to SharePoint**: Upload your documents to SharePoint document libraries or sites (if not already there)
    2. **Set up credentials**: Configure your SharePoint credentials in **Settings** ‚Üí **Credentials** 
    3. **Create SharePoint Toolkit**: Go to **Toolkits** ‚Üí **+ Create** ‚Üí **SharePoint** and configure with your site details
    4. **Index your data**: Use the "Index Data" tool from the SharePoint Toolkit to create searchable indexes
    5. **Search and chat**: Use the toolkit in conversations or agents to query your indexed SharePoint content
    
    This provides the same SharePoint indexing capabilities as the previous Datasources system with improved performance and integration.

This guide provides a complete step-by-step walkthrough for indexing SharePoint data and then searching or chatting with the indexed content using ELITEA's AI-powered tools.

## Overview

SharePoint indexing allows you to create searchable indexes from your SharePoint document management and collaboration content:

- **Documents & Files**: Word documents, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other file types
- **Document Libraries**: Organized collections of documents with metadata and version control
- **Lists & Custom Data**: Task lists, contact lists, custom data tables, and project tracking information
- **Site Collections**: Multiple SharePoint sites organized under a shared management structure
- **Metadata & Properties**: Document properties, custom fields, and content categorization

**What you can do with indexed SharePoint data:**

- **Semantic Search**: Find documents and content across SharePoint sites using natural language queries
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Get AI-generated answers from your document content with citations to specific files
- **Cross-Site Discovery**: Search across multiple SharePoint sites and document libraries
- **Document Analysis**: Extract insights and summaries from business documents and reports
- **Content Organization**: Analyze document types, usage patterns, and content relationships

**Common use cases:**

- Finding specific documents, policies, or procedures across your organization's SharePoint sites
- Onboarding new employees by allowing them to ask questions about company documents and processes
- Analyzing project documents and extracting key information for reporting and decision-making
- Support teams searching for solutions and documentation from indexed knowledge bases
- Compliance and audit teams finding relevant documents based on content and metadata

### Real-Life Example Workflow

Let's walk through a complete example of indexing and using a company's SharePoint document library:

**Step 1: Setup SharePoint Toolkit for Document Management**

**Step 2: Use in Conversations**

   Add toolkit to a conversation and start asking questions:

  - Navigate to **Conversations** ‚Üí **+ New Conversation**
  - In the participants section click + to add Toolkit
  - Select your SharePoint toolkit from the available toolkits list

**Step 3: Index the Document Library**

 * **User Request in Chat:**
 
     > "Index all documents from our SharePoint site with suffix 'docs'. Include Word and PDF files but skip image files. Clean any existing index first."

   ![SharePoint Index Chat](../../img/how-tos/indexing/sharepoint/sharepoint-index-chat.png)

**Step 4: Verify Index Creation**

 * **User Request in Chat:**
 
     > "List my collections"

 * **SharePoint Toolkit Response:**

![SharePoint List](../../img/how-tos/indexing/sharepoint/sharepoint-list-collections.png)

 This confirms the indexing completed successfully and your document collection is available for searching.

**Step 5: Start the conversation and begin asking questions about your indexed content**

  * **User:** "What are the key points from our Q3 financial report?"
   
  * **SharePoint Toolkit:** "Based on your indexed documents, here are the key points from the Q3 financial report:
   
    1. **Revenue Growth**: 15% increase compared to Q2, reaching $2.3M total revenue
    2. **Cost Management**: Operating expenses reduced by 8% through efficiency initiatives

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Errors and Solutions

**"Indexes tab not visible" or "Tab disabled":**

- Verify PgVector and Embedding Model are configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
- Ensure the **Index Data** tool is enabled in your SharePoint toolkit configuration
- Check that your toolkit supports indexing (SharePoint is supported)
- Refresh the browser page and retry

**"+ Create New Index button not working":**

- Verify all project-level prerequisites are met (PgVector and Embedding Model)
- Check that you have proper permissions for the toolkit
- Ensure the toolkit is properly saved with credentials

**"Authentication failed" or "Unauthorized access":**

  - Verify your SharePoint credential has the correct Client ID and Client Secret
  - Ensure your Azure AD app registration has appropriate permissions for SharePoint access
  - Check that admin consent has been granted for the application permissions
  - Verify the SharePoint site URL format includes `https://` and the complete site path

**"Site not found" or "Access denied to site":**

  - Verify the SharePoint site URL is correct and accessible
  - Ensure your Azure AD app has been granted permissions to the specific site collection using AppInv.aspx
  - Check that the site collection exists and is not archived or deleted
  - Confirm your app registration has the necessary SharePoint API permissions

**"No files indexed" or "Empty document library":**

  - Check that the document library contains accessible files
  - Verify file extensions are not being filtered out by Skip Extensions parameter
  - Ensure your app has read permissions to the document library
  - Try indexing without extension filters first, then add restrictions

**"Vector database connection failed" or "PgVector errors":**

  - Ensure PgVector is properly configured in Settings ‚Üí AI Configuration
  - Verify the vector database is running and accessible
  - Check connection credentials and database permissions
  - Restart the vector database service if connection issues persist

**"File processing errors" or "Document parsing failures":**

  - Large files may cause timeouts; consider using file size limits or Skip Extensions
  - Binary files (executables, archives) should be excluded via Skip Extensions
  - Check available storage space for the vector database
  - Verify document formats are supported (Word, PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, text files)

### Performance and Scope Considerations

**For Large SharePoint Sites:**

- Use file type filters: `Include Extensions: ["*.docx", "*.pdf", "*.xlsx"]`
- Set reasonable file limits: start with 500-1000 files for testing
- Consider indexing by document library: create separate indexes for different libraries
- Index by content type: separate indexes for documents vs. lists vs. archived content

### Search Result Quality

**If search returns few/no results:**

- Lower the cut-off score from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3
- Increase search_top from 10 to 20 or 30
- Try rephrasing your query with document-specific terms (file names, content types)
- Verify the indexed content contains relevant information for your query

**For better search quality:**

- Include multiple document types for comprehensive coverage
- Use natural language queries rather than exact file names
- Leverage stepback search for complex business questions that require reasoning
- Create separate indexes for different content types (current vs archived, public vs restricted)

### Content-Specific Indexing Tips

**For Business Documents:**

- Focus on current documents: exclude outdated templates and archived files
- Include metadata-rich content: documents with proper titles, descriptions, and tags
- Index both working documents and finalized reports for complete coverage

**For Project Management:**

- Include project templates, status reports, and planning documents
- Index across multiple project sites for portfolio-level insights
- Consider including both active and completed projects for lessons learned

**For Knowledge Management:**

- Include policy documents, procedures, and training materials
- Index FAQ documents and troubleshooting guides for support scenarios
- Focus on documents with high business value and frequent access patterns
