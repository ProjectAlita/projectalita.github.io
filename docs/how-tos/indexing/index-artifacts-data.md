# Index Artifacts Data

!!! warning "Availability"
    Indexing tools are available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) (Release 1.7.0) and replace legacy Datasources/Datasets. For context, see [Release Notes 1.7.0](../../release-notes/rn_current.md#indexing-tools-replacement-for-datasets) and the [Indexing Overview](./indexing-overview.md).


This guide provides a complete step-by-step walkthrough for indexing Artifacts data and then searching or chatting with the indexed content using ELITEA's AI-powered tools.

!!! info "Primary Interface"
    Indexing operations are performed through the **Indexes** interface within Toolkit Configuration. This interface provides comprehensive index management with visual status indicators, real-time progress monitoring, and integrated search capabilities. For detailed information, see [How to create and use indexes](./using-indexes-tab-interface.md).

## Overview

Artifacts indexing allows you to create searchable indexes from files stored in your project's Artifact buckets:

- **Document Files**: Text files, Word documents, PDFs, and other document formats
- **Data Files**: CSV, Excel, JSON files and structured data formats
- **Code Files**: Source code, configuration files, and technical documentation
- **Research Assets**: Analysis reports, findings, and research documentation
- **Temporary Storage**: Processing results, intermediate files, and workflow outputs

**What you can do with indexed Artifacts data:**

- **Semantic Search**: Find specific content across multiple files using natural language queries
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Get AI-generated answers from your file content with citations
- **Cross-File Discovery**: Search across all files in your Artifact buckets for comprehensive insights
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze patterns, themes, and information across your stored documents
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Transform file content into searchable organizational knowledge

**Common use cases:**

- Indexing research documentation and analysis reports for quick information retrieval
- Making project deliverables and documentation searchable for team collaboration
- Creating searchable knowledge bases from uploaded files and documents
- Analyzing data files and reports to extract insights and answer specific questions
- Organizing and finding content in temporary storage used during AI workflows

!!! info "Migration from Datasources"
    In previous releases, there was a **Source type: File** option in Datasources. Now, Datasources have been removed from ELITEA, and users can perform the same action through Artifacts.
    
    **How to migrate from Datasources to Artifacts:**
    
    1. **Upload your files**: Navigate to **ELITEA** → **Artifacts** and upload your files to a bucket (or drag & drop them directly)
    2. **Create Artifact Toolkit**: Go to **Toolkits** → **+ Create** → **Artifact** and configure with your bucket name
    3. **Index your data**: Use the "Index Data" tool from the Artifact Toolkit to create searchable indexes
    4. **Search and chat**: Use the toolkit in conversations or agents to query your indexed content
    
    This provides the same file indexing capabilities as the previous Datasources system with improved performance and integration.
