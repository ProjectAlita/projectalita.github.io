## What is Canvas?
Canvas is a built-in editor that appears automatically when ELITEA generates code, tables, or [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) diagrams in a chat.

### Key Benefits:
- Instant Editing: Modify content on the fly, eliminating the need for external tools.
- Version Control: Easily track changes with built-in undo/redo functionality.
- Flexible Exporting: Save or copy your refined content in various formats suitable for documentation, code repositories, or reports.

### Canvas supports three primary content types:

| **Content Type**   | **Description**                          | **Common Uses**                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Blocks**     | For programming and scripting languages. | Python, Java, SQL, YAML, Selenium scripts.          |
| **Tables**          | For structured, tabular data.            | Test cases, requirements matrices, data sets.       |
| **Mermaid Diagrams**| For text-based visual diagrams.          | Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERDs.                |

 
## Getting Started: Accessing and Using Canvas

Using Canvas is a simple, three-step process.
 
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to an [ELITEA conversation](how-to-use-chat-functionality.md) with supported participants, such as Agents, Pipelines, or LLM Models.
- The AI participant (Agent, Pipeline, or LLM Model) should generate content in the form of a code block, a Markdown table, or a Mermaid diagram.
 

### Step 1: Generate Canvas-Compatible Content

Start by asking ELITEA to create something for you.

**Example Prompts**:
- "Generate a Python Selenium script to test the login page." (for Code)
- "Create a Markdown table with test cases for user registration, including columns for Test Case ID, Step, Expected Result, and Status." (for Tables)
- "Create a Mermaid flowchart for an e-commerce order approval process." (for Diagrams)

### Step 2: Activate Canvas

Once ELITEA generates the content, look for the pencil icon (✏️) in the top-right corner of the content block. This icon indicates that Canvas is available.

![Canvas_Edit](../img/how-tos/canvas/Canvas_Edit.png)

Click the pencil icon to launch the Canvas editor for that content block.*

### Step 3: Edit Content

Clicking the icon opens the Canvas editor in a modal window. Here, you can directly modify the content. 

### Navigating the Canvas Interface

All Canvas editors share a set of universal controls:

| **Icon**       | **Action**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Copy**       | Copy to Clipboard   | Copies the entire content to your clipboard.                                   |
| **Undo/Redo**  | Undo / Redo         | Reverts or reapplies your last action.                                         |
| **Save**       | Save Changes        | Saves your current progress. Remember to save often!                           |
| **Export**     | Export/Download     | Allows you to download the content in various formats (e.g., `.py`, `.xlsx`, `.png`). |

### A Deep Dive into Canvas Editors

Let's explore the unique features of each editor and see how they apply in real-world situations.

#### The Code Editor

**Perfect for developers, AQA engineers, and DevOps.**  
The Code Editor is a robust environment for refining AI-generated code snippets and scripts. It features syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error checking to help you write production-ready code.

**Key Features**

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improves readability for languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and YAML.
- **Find/Replace**: Quickly locate and update variables, function names, or other text strings.
- **Code Folding**: Collapse functions or classes to focus on a specific part of the code.

**Real-World Example: Refining an AQA Test Script**  
- **Role**: Sarah, an AQA Engineer.  
- **Goal**: Create a reliable Selenium test for a new checkout feature.  

1. **Generate**: Sarah asks ELITEA: "Write a Selenium Python script to add an item to the cart and proceed to checkout."
2. **Activate Canvas**: The AI generates a functional but basic script. Sarah clicks the ✏️ icon to open it in the Code Editor.
3. **Refine in Canvas**:
   - She adds explicit waits to handle slow-loading page elements, making the script more stable.
   - She uses **Find/Replace** to change a generic variable name like `button` to a more descriptive name like `proceed_to_checkout_button`.
   - She adds a `try/except` block for error handling, ensuring the test fails gracefully and provides useful logs.
   - She adds comments to explain complex steps to her teammates.
4. **Export**: Once satisfied, Sarah clicks **Export** and saves the file as `test_checkout.py`, ready to be committed to her team's automation framework.

#### The Table Editor

**Ideal for Business Analysts, QA Analysts, and Project Managers.**  
The Table Editor transforms simple Markdown tables into a powerful, spreadsheet-like interface for organizing and managing structured data.

**Key Features**

- **Easy Cell Editing**: Click any cell to modify its content.
- **Structural Changes**: Add or remove rows and columns with a single click.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Quickly organize your data to find what you need.
- **Import/Export**: Export your table to formats like XLSX (Excel) or Markdown.

**Real-World Example: Test Case Documentation**  
- **Role**: David (Business Analyst).  
- **Goal**: Document test cases for a new user profile feature.  

1. **Generate**: David asks ELITEA: "Create a test case table for editing a user profile."
2. **Activate Canvas**: The AI generates a table with columns for ID, Step, and Expected Result. David clicks the ✏️ icon to open the table in Canvas.
3. **Refine in Canvas**:
   - David adds a new column called "Requirement ID" and populates it, linking each test case back to the original business requirements.
   - He adds another column for "Priority" (High, Medium, Low) to categorize the test cases.
   - Using the **Sort** feature, David organizes the table to display all "High" priority test cases first.
   - He reviews the steps and updates the "Expected Result" column to ensure clarity and accuracy.
4. **Export**: Once satisfied, David clicks **Export** and chooses XLSX. He now has a formatted spreadsheet to share with the testing team and stakeholders.

#### The Mermaid Diagram Editor

**A visual tool for Business Analysts, System Architects, and anyone needing to map processes.**  
The Mermaid Diagram Editor allows you to edit the simple text-based syntax of a Mermaid diagram while seeing your changes rendered visually in real-time.

**Key Features**

- **Live Preview**: The diagram updates instantly as you type.
- **Syntax Highlighting & Error Detection**: Quickly spots issues in your Mermaid code.
- **Multiple Export Options**: Save your finished diagram as a PNG, JPG, or SVG image file.

**Real-World Example: Visualizing a Business Process**  
- **Role**: Tom, a Business Analyst.  
- **Goal**: Create a clear flowchart for a new expense approval workflow to present to stakeholders.  

1. **Generate**: Tom asks ELITEA: "Generate a Mermaid flowchart for an employee submitting an expense report that needs manager approval."
2. **Activate Canvas**: ELITEA provides a simple, linear flowchart. Tom opens it in Canvas.
3. **Refine in Canvas**:
   - Using the **Live Preview**, Tom adds a decision point: `If Amount > $500`.
   - He adds two new paths from this decision: one for "Senior Manager Approval" and another back to the standard "Manager Approval."
   - He adds styling to the "Rejected" end-state node to make it red, highlighting the negative path.
4. **Export**: Happy with the visual, Tom clicks **Export** and saves the diagram as a PNG, ready to be inserted directly into his PowerPoint presentation.


### Tips and Best Practices

- **Start with a Clear Prompt**: The better your initial prompt, the less refinement you'll need. Be specific about formats and requirements.
- **Save Often**: Use the Save button regularly to ensure all changes are captured.
- **Use for Configuration Files**: The Code Editor is excellent for generating and refining YAML or JSON configuration files for CI/CD pipelines or application settings.
- **Follow Team Standards**: Use Canvas to enforce your team’s coding and documentation conventions before exporting.


### Troubleshooting Common Issues
**Q: The Canvas pencil icon (✏️) isn't appearing.**  
**A:** Ensure the AI-generated content is a properly formatted code block, Markdown table, or Mermaid diagram. If the format is incorrect, try re-phrasing your prompt to be more specific (e.g., "format the output as a Markdown table").

**Q: The editor is slow or unresponsive.**  
**A:** This can happen with extremely large blocks of code or tables. Try breaking your request into smaller chunks. Also, check your internet connection and consider clearing your browser cache.

**Q: I'm having trouble exporting my content.**  
**A:** Check that the file format you're trying to export to is supported for that editor. If an issue persists, try a different web browser or contact support.
