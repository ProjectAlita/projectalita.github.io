# Quick Guide: Working with Canvas in ELITEA Chat

---

## 1. What is Canvas?

Canvas is a built-in editor in ELITEA Chat that allows you to seamlessly edit, refine, and manage AI-generated code, tables, and diagrams directly within your conversation—without switching to external tools.

## 2. How to Activate Canvas

1. In your chat conversation, ask ELITEA to generate code, a table, or a diagram.
2. Canvas appears automatically when an AI participant (Agent, Pipeline, or LLM Model) generates:
- **Code blocks**
- **Markdown tables**
- **Mermaid diagrams**
3. When you see the content block you want to edit, locate the **pencil icon (✏️)** at its top-right corner.
4. Click the **pencil icon (✏️)** to open the content in the Canvas editor.
5. The Canvas editor will appear in a modal window, letting you make direct changes.
