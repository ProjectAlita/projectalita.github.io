## Information
 
* **Release Version**: 1.7.2
* **Released on**: 24-Oct-2025
* **Access for 1.7.2**: [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai)

 
## Important

- **Availability**: Version 1.7.2 is available in the [Next environment](https://next.elitea.ai) only. Nexus will remain on its current version (1.6.0) for now. The **Next** environment contains a full copy of your projects, agents, pipelines, toolkits, and chats migrated from Nexus, plus all 1.7.2 features and updates. Use this safe transition window to review changes, configure new Indexes, set up Credentials, and verify your workflows before Nexus is upgraded.
- **Prompts deprecated**: The **Prompts** entity is deprecated. All existing prompts were converted to Agents. You can create Agents without attaching a Toolkit (a lightweight replacement for Prompts) and use variables with these agents.
- **Datasources deprecated**: The **Datasources** entity is deprecated. Your existing datasources remain available in this release so you can re-index and reconfigure them using the new **Index data** tool available in most Toolkits (e.g., GitHub, Confluence, Bitbucket, ADO Repos, Jira, etc.),  as even though they remain connected to agents, they cannot be used (as the datasets themselves are not migrated). **Note**: Creating new datasources or datasets is no longer supported.
- **Integrations replaced by Credentials**: Integrations are deprecated and replaced by Credentials as a standalone entity. Existing Integrations are not auto-migrated; recreate them as **Credentials** manually. See: [How to Use Credentials](../how-tos/how-to-use-credentials.md).
- **Toolkits separated**: Toolkits are now a standalone entity under the Toolkits menu. Agents and Pipelines that previously had connected toolkits still keep those links; you can also reuse Toolkits across multiple entities. See: [How to create a toolkit](../getting-started/create-toolkit.md).
- **Temporary limitations (Next environment)**: Exporting agents/pipelines from Nexus and importing them into Next is not supported due to compatibility differences. **Forking** functionality may not work fully in **Next**. Both will be redesigned and enhanced in the upcoming release.
- **Shared LLM models (Next environment)**: The LLM models provided in **Next** are shared and intended for evaluation only and have daily limits. For any production workload, request your own EPAM AI DIAL keys and configure them in Settings → [AI Configuration](../menus/settings/ai-configuration.md). For a quick walkthrough, see the: [How to configure and use Epam AI Dial keys](../getting-started/create-credential.md).

## New Features
 
### Chat: Support Images as attachments

You can now add images to a conversation and have agents or pipelines analyze them, plus receive AI‑generated images directly inline in the chat thread.

**What you can do now:**
* **Upload images** via drag & drop or file picker.
* **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, and non‑animated GIF.
* **Inline AI outputs**: Agents can return generated images as part of their response; they display inline just like user uploads.
* **Persistent storage**: All uploaded and generated images are stored durably with stable IDs/URLs and can be revisited from chat history and the Artifacts menu.
* **Reuse across sessions**: Reopen a conversation later and re-reference prior images without re-uploading.

This feature unlocks visual analysis use cases (UI reviews, diagram interpretation, data screenshot extraction) and enables workflows combining text + vision + generated imagery in a single conversational flow.


### Indexing: Dedicated Toolkit Indexes Tab

A new Indexing tab is now available inside supported toolkits, giving you a consolidated workspace to manage and inspect all indexes created through that toolkit.

**What you can do now:**
* **View all indexes** associated with the toolkit in a single, paginated list (name, type/source, size, last updated, status).
* **Create new indexes** directly from the tab without leaving the toolkit configuration screen.
* **Reindex or refresh** an existing index to pull updated content (with clear in‑progress status feedback).
* **Delete obsolete indexes** to remove stale or unnecessary data and free resources.
* **Search & filter** indexes by name, status, or last updated time for faster navigation.
* **Inspect configuration**: Open an index detail panel to view configuration parameters (scope, filters, model/embedding settings, created by, timestamps).
* **History & activity**: *(available from next release)*: See recent operations (created, reindexed, failed attempts) with timestamps and outcomes for auditability.
* **Auto-Update Scheduler** *(available from next release)*: Configure automated updates for indexes at scheduled intervals to keep your data fresh without manual reindexing.

**Benefits:** Centralizes lifecycle management of indexed data, reduces duplication, and improves transparency into what content your agents and pipelines can search.

For usage examples of indexing tools, see [Index GitHub data](../how-tos/indexing/index-github-data.md).


### Canvas: Edit Pipelines from Chat

Edit pipelines directly from chat conversations using Canvas, without leaving the active conversation context.

**What you can do now:**
* **Quick access**: Click the **Pencil icon** in Participants or the **Gear icon** when selecting a pipeline from chat input.
* **Configuration tab**: Adjust LLM model, toolkits, conversation starters, welcome message, steps limit, attachment permissions, and Pyodide sandbox settings.
* **Flow Editor tab**: Choose between visual drag-and-drop node configuration (Flow sub-tab) or direct YAML editing (YAML sub-tab).
* **Responsive canvas**: Resize by dragging the left edge to fit your screen.
* **Version-specific editing**: Changes apply only to the selected pipeline version.
* **Save or discard**: Commit changes with **Save** or cancel with **Discard** without affecting the pipeline.

This keeps you in the conversation flow, reduces context switching, and enables rapid iteration on pipeline logic with immediate testing in the same chat session.

For detailed guidance, see [Canvas Agent & Pipeline Editing](../how-tos/how-to-canvas-agent-pipeline-editing.md).


### Canvas: Create Toolkit and MCP Server

* Create a new toolkit directly from a conversation using Canvas, without leaving Chat.
* Create a new MCP server from the same Canvas interface.
* Configure credentials, settings (e.g., namespace or connection details), and select tools during creation.
* Automatically attach the newly created toolkit or MCP server to the active conversation so it can be used immediately.
* Reuse created toolkits or MCP servers across other agents, pipelines, and conversations.


### Chat: Configurable Pyodide (Python) Sandbox Tool

Control Python code execution in conversations with a new toggle button for the Pyodide sandbox tool.

**What you can do now:**
* **Toggle button in chat input**: A new icon next to the Attachments button lets you enable or disable the Python sandbox tool (pyodide_sandbox) on demand.
* **Default state**: Disabled by default to avoid unnecessary tool invocation for non-Python queries.
* **Available everywhere**: The toggle is available in Conversations (Chat menu), Agents menu, and Pipelines menu chat inputs.
* **Session persistence**: Your enable/disable choice persists throughout the conversation session.
* **Smart invocation**: The tool activates only when enabled and when Python-related input is detected (e.g., "Write a Python script to calculate Fibonacci").
* **Clear guidance**: Hover over the icon to see a tooltip explaining the feature and recommended use cases.

This gives you precise control over when Python code execution is available, reducing unwanted tool calls and improving response accuracy for general queries.


### Jira: Atlassian API v3 Support

Jira toolkit now supports Atlassian API v3, ensuring compatibility with the latest Jira Cloud instances that require the updated API version.

**What changed:**
* **API v3 compatibility**: JQL searches and other Jira operations now work seamlessly with new Jira Cloud versions that mandate API v3 (`/rest/api/3/search/jql`).
* **Backward compatibility**: Existing Jira integrations using API v2 continue to work without modification.
* **Automatic version selection**: The toolkit detects and uses the appropriate API version based on your Jira instance configuration.
* **Improved efficiency**: Native v3 support eliminates the need for workarounds using generic request tools, reducing token usage and simplifying agent instructions.

This update ensures uninterrupted access to Jira data across both legacy and modern Jira Cloud deployments. **Note**: Atlassian API v3 support for Confluence toolkit will be available in future releases.


### MCP: Toolkits Available as Local Tools

ELITEA Toolkits are now accessible as local MCP tools in external clients like GitHub Copilot, alongside agents and pipelines.

**What you can do now:**
* **Discover all project toolkits**: Connect your ELITEA project and browse all available toolkits from MCP clients without requiring MCP tags.
* **Execute toolkit tools directly**: Run individual toolkit tools from GitHub Copilot chat or other MCP-compatible clients.
* **No tagging required**: Unlike agents and pipelines (which require MCP tags), all toolkits in your connected project are automatically available.
* **Unified workflow**: Access agents, pipelines, and toolkits from a single MCP connection for seamless cross-platform integration.

This expands MCP capabilities beyond agents and pipelines, enabling direct toolkit execution from your preferred development environment.

  
## Changed Features
 
### Pipeline Enhancements and Node Model Changes

We redesigned the pipeline node model to make building, reading, and maintaining pipelines faster and more intuitive. The updated node set focuses each node on a single clear responsibility, adds visual color-coding for instant recognition, and removes legacy, overlapping nodes that previously caused confusion. These changes reduce setup friction, clarify configuration options, and improve troubleshooting.

**Color coding:** Each node type now has a distinct color family (e.g., Execution, Data, Control, Integration) so you can scan complex graphs and immediately understand structure without opening each node.

**Vertical flow layout:** Pipelines now use vertical orientation in Flow mode, with nodes arranged top-to-bottom instead of left-to-right. This improves readability, better integrates with chat-based editing workflows, and provides more natural flow visualization for complex pipelines.

**Enhanced LLM node:** The LLM node has been redesigned with separate **System** and **Task** fields replacing the previous Prompt field, giving you clearer control over context and instructions. Each field supports three input types: F-String (dynamic variable interpolation), Variable (direct state reference), or Fixed (static text). The node now also supports adding multiple toolkits and MCPs directly, with granular control to enable or disable individual tools—expanding LLM capabilities without requiring additional Function nodes.


### Pipeline States: Redesigned Management Interface

Pipeline state management has been redesigned to provide a clearer, more intuitive workflow for configuring and managing state variables in Flow mode.

**What changed:**
* **States sidebar**: Click the new **States button** (located under the **+** node button in Flow mode) to open a resizable sidebar on the right displaying all states.
* **Default states**: The default **input** and **messages** states are always visible with toggle switches to activate/deactivate them as needed.
* **Icon-based visualization**: State types (string, list, JSON, number) are represented by icons instead of text for faster recognition.
* **Add custom states**: Click **+ Context** to add new state variables with validated names (letters, numbers, underscores only; must start with a letter), type selection, and optional default values.
* **Multi-line input**: Default value fields expand to 5-row text areas when the sidebar is resized, making it easier to enter and review longer values.
* **Real-time save**: State changes are applied and saved instantly without requiring a separate pipeline-wide save action.
* **Resizable sidebar**: Drag the left edge to adjust sidebar width to your preference; the size persists during your session.

**Why this is better:**
* More intuitive access and visual clarity for state configuration.
* Reduces errors with validated state names and clear type indicators.
* Instant save eliminates the risk of losing state configuration changes.
* Consistent interface across Pipelines menu and Canvas editing mode.
