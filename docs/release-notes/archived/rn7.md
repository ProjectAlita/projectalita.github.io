## Known Issues

* **GIT Source Authentication**: SSH authentication for GIT sources fails. **Workaround**: Use HTTPS with Username and Password.
* **Collections Import**: After importing Collections, new collections are not being created under the Collections section.
* **Test Connection**: The test connection functionality for the toolkit is currently experiencing issues and may not operate correctly.
  **Confluence Dataset Label Filtering**: When using multiple labels (two or more) as a filter while creating a dataset of Confluence type, an error occurs. The system raises an `ApiValueError`, indicating that the CQL (Confluence Query Language) is invalid or missing. **Workaround**: Use a single label as a filter to avoid this issue.
* **Confluence Dataset and Toolkit Access to Private Pages**: The Confluence dataset and toolkit currently cannot access private pages. Most private pages in Confluence are inaccessible to ELITEA, limiting the ability to retrieve or interact with restricted content.
* **"Add to Collection" Option Missing in Table View for Public Projects**: When working within a Public project, users currently can add entities (e.g., Prompts) to a Collection only from the Detailed (List) View. If the user switches to the Cards View and selects a Prompt to view its details, the "Add to Collection" option icon is not displayed. **Workaround**: Use the Detailed (List) View to add entities to Collections until this issue is resolved.
