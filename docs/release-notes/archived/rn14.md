* **Auto-generated naming**: Conversation names are automatically generated based on your first message content.
* **Focused naming indicator**: The loader icon and "Naming" text appear only during the brief name generation process (1-2 seconds), not before you've started typing.

**Benefits:** Cleaner and more intuitive conversation creation experience with reduced cognitive load, eliminated premature placeholder conversations, and alignment with popular chat application patterns like ChatGPT.

For more information about this, see [Chat Usage](../../how-tos/chat-conversations/how-to-use-chat-functionality.md).

### Chat: Intelligent Attachment Bucket Management

Attachment storage is now automatically configured from agents with full manual control, clear visibility, and intelligent bucket inheritance.

**What changed:**

* **Automatic bucket inheritance**: Adding an agent with a configured attachment bucket automatically sets it as the conversation's attachment bucket, eliminating manual configuration for each conversation.
* **First-agent priority**: When adding multiple agents with different buckets, the first agent's bucket is used; subsequent agents' buckets are ignored to maintain consistent storage.
* **Manual override capability**: Change the attachment bucket at any time via the settings icon in Participants → Toolkits; manual selections take precedence over future agent additions.
* **Persistent configuration**: Attachment buckets remain active even when agents are removed from the conversation, ensuring previously uploaded files stay accessible.
* **Public agent bucket creation**: Public agents automatically create buckets in your current project context (Private or Team) if they don't already exist.
* **Clear visual indicators**: Active attachment buckets appear in Participants → Toolkits with a 📎 icon, bucket name, project type badge (Private/Team), and management controls.
* **Unified artifact storage**: Artifact toolkit uses the conversation's attachment bucket when present, avoiding duplicate bucket configurations.

**Benefits:** Reduces attachment configuration friction by 70%, provides seamless agent-to-conversation bucket inheritance, ensures clear visibility of active storage location, and maintains full user control with manual override capabilities.

For more information about this feature, see [Attachements in Conversation](../../how-tos/chat-conversations/attach-images-and-files-in-chat.md).

### Toolkits: ADO Repos Credential Simplification

ADO Repos toolkit configuration is now simpler and more consistent by reusing the standard ADO credential and moving repository-specific configuration into the toolkit.

**What changed:**

* **ADO Repos credential removed**: ADO Repos no longer uses a separate credential type; configure and reuse your existing **ADO credential** instead.
* **Repository ID moved to toolkit**: A new **Repository ID** field is now part of the ADO Repos toolkit configuration.
* **Repository ID is required**: Repository ID is now a mandatory field and appears before **Base branch**.
* **Seamless transition**: Migrations are provided to support existing configurations.

**Benefits:** Reduces configuration overhead and credential confusion, standardizes Azure DevOps authentication across toolkits, and makes ADO Repos setup more predictable.

For more information about ADO credentials, see [How to Use Credentials](../../how-tos/credentials-toolkits/how-to-use-credentials.md#ado-azure-devops-credential-setup).

### Model Settings: Simplified Configuration with Auto Mode

Token management and model parameters are now easier to configure with auto mode defaults and intuitive control settings for both technical and non-technical users.

**What changed:**

* **Auto token management**: `max_completion_tokens` now defaults to "auto" (uses model defaults), with option to set explicit integer values for custom limits.
* **Creativity control**: Replaced `temperature` with **Creativity** setting using a 3-5 dimension scale for intuitive model behavior tuning.
* **Reasoning levels**: Replaced `max_p` and `max_k` with **Reasoning** (hi/med/lo) for simplified response control.
* **State-saving for continuity**: Chat and agent sessions now save state when token limits are reached, with a "Continue" button to resume generation while preserving full context and history.

**Benefits:** Simplifies model configuration for non-technical users, eliminates manual token calculations, provides intuitive control dimensions, prevents context loss during long generations, and maintains advanced customization options for power users.

### Pipelines: Node Deprecations and New Node Types

The pipeline node architecture has been streamlined with new specialized nodes and deprecation of legacy nodes to simplify pipeline design and reduce configuration complexity.

**New Node Types Introduced:**

* **Toolkit Node**: Dedicated node for executing individual toolkit tools with input/output state mapping, interrupt settings, and tool-specific field configuration. Select from toolkits added to your pipeline, choose specific tools, and configure tool parameters directly in the node—replacing the generic Function/Tool approach with toolkit-specific clarity.
* **MCP Node**: Specialized node for executing MCP server tools with the same configuration capabilities as Toolkit Node. Provides clean separation between toolkit and MCP tool execution for better pipeline organization.
* **Printer Node**: Display formatted output to users without LLM processing or tool invocation. Supports F-string formatting (enabled by default) for dynamic variable interpolation, multiple input variables, and configurable Interrupt Before/After settings (Interrupt After enabled by default). Ideal for showing intermediate results, progress updates, or data summaries during pipeline execution—faster and more consistent than using LLM nodes for simple output display.

!!! note "Node Deprecation Timeline"
    The following nodes are marked as deprecated in this release and will be removed in 2026. Existing pipelines using these nodes will continue to function, but you cannot add new instances of deprecated nodes. Migration guides are available to help transition to replacement nodes.

**Enhanced Agent Node:**

* **Agent Node**: The Agent node has been enhanced to support pipeline execution alongside agent execution, providing a unified interface for both use cases. Agent nodes can now execute pipelines that do not contain interruptions or subgraphs (nested pipelines), supporting standard sequential and conditional flows. This enhancement simplifies workflow creation and reduces the need for separate node types.

**Deprecated Nodes (Marked for 2026 Removal):**

* **Function Node** (deprecated): Replaced by **Toolkit Node** and **MCP Node**. The Function node handled both toolkits and MCPs in a single node type, creating configuration confusion. Dedicated Toolkit and MCP nodes provide clearer separation and improved usability.
* **Tool Node** (deprecated): Replaced by **Toolkit Node** and **MCP Node**. Functionality now fully covered by the dedicated replacement nodes with enhanced capabilities.
* **Condition Node** (deprecated): Replaced by **Router Node**. The Router node provides more robust and flexible conditional routing with better configuration options and clearer branching logic.
* **Decision Node** (redesigned and deprecated old version): The legacy "semi-node" Decision Node attached to other nodes is deprecated. A new standalone **Decision Node** functions independently, accepts multiple input connections, and operates similarly to Router Node. The new Decision Node supports its own input/output state management and decision logic configuration without dependency on connected nodes.
* **Pipeline Node** (deprecated): Replaced by enhanced **Agent Node**. The Agent node now supports pipeline execution for pipelines without interruptions or subgraphs, providing a unified interface for both agents and pipelines. Validation prevents adding unsupported pipeline types with clear error messages.
* **Loop Node and Loop for Tool Node** (deprecated): These nodes were overly complicated for configuration and everyday usage. Alternative pipeline patterns using simpler nodes and design patterns are recommended. Simpler approaches provide the same iteration capabilities with better clarity and easier maintenance.

**Migration Support:**

* No automatic migration is provided—existing pipelines continue to work with deprecated nodes.
* Comprehensive migration guides available with step-by-step instructions, visual diagrams, and example conversions.
* New nodes provide full feature parity with deprecated nodes, including input/output states, input mappings, and interrupt configurations.

**Benefits:** Clearer node responsibilities reduce configuration errors, specialized nodes improve pipeline readability, and removing overlapping legacy nodes simplifies learning curve for new users while maintaining full functionality for existing workflows.

For detailed migration guidance, see [Migration Overview: migration/v2.0.0 B2/migration-overview.md](../../migration/v2.0.1/migration-overview.md).
 

### Toolkits: Standardized Name and Description Fields
