    * Persist user-selected filters during sessions in **Monitoring** Tabs for entities and the Monitoring page.
    * Introduce a special '**Monitor**' role to provide a more accurate representation of active project users and usage metrics by hiding specific users (e.g., Epam admins and Support Engineers) from the project users list and excluding them from monitoring calculations.
    * Show monitoring data per entity (for each prompt, datasource, and agent).
    * Add new key metrics, **Engagement** and **Acceptance rate**, to provide deeper insights into user interaction and satisfaction:
        * **Engagement**: Measures the percentage of active users out of all users who logged into ELITEA for the selected period.
