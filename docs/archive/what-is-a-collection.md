# What is a Collection?


## Collections in ELITEA

A collection is an organized group of related agents and pipelines that can be managed, shared, and reused together. Think of collections as folders or libraries that help you keep your ELITEA agents and pipelines well-organized and easily accessible to your team.

ELITEA collections provide a structured way to manage your agents and pipelines. Each collection can include multiple agents and pipelines, allowing you to package complete workflows, share best practices, and maintain project-specific configurations efficiently.

Key characteristics:

- **Organized**: Group related agents and pipelines together for better management
- **Shareable**: Collections can be shared with teammates and across projects
- **Reusable**: Export and import collections to replicate setups across environments
- **Multi-Entity Support**: Combine agents and pipelines in one collection
- **Team Collaboration**: Share collections with teammates for consistent workflows
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain different versions of collections
- **Easy Distribution**: Export collections for backup or sharing across different ELITEA instances

Perfect for organizing project workflows, maintaining team standards, sharing best practices, and ensuring consistent setups across different environments.

## Collection Examples

ELITEA supports various types of collections for different organizational needs. Here are some popular examples:

- **Project Collections**: Group all agents and pipelines needed for a specific project workflow
