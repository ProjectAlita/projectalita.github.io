**Using the Prompt Magic Assistant:**

1. **Describe Your Task:** Once the Magic Assistant window is open, you will see a text input field. Clearly and concisely describe the task you want the prompt to accomplish. The more detailed your description, the better the assistant can understand your needs and generate relevant suggestions.

    *   **Example:** "I want to generate manual test cases for covering positive, negative, and edge cases. The test cases must be in Gherkin syntax and keep in mind the possibility for easy automation later. The test cases must be generated for the provided acceptance criteria."

    *   **Example:** "You are an experienced Business Analyst tasked with creating a user story. Your goal is to generate a user story that adheres to the INVEST principles and includes proper acceptance criteria. The user story should be user-centric, facilitating effective communication and prioritization between development teams and stakeholders."

2. **Generate Prompt Ideas:** After entering your task description, click the **Generate Prompt** button. The Magic Assistant will analyze your input and generate suggestions for various prompt elements.

* **Prompt Name:** A suggested name for your prompt, reflecting the task you described.
* **Prompt Description:** A brief explanation of the prompt's purpose, derived from your input.
* **Context:**  The core instructions and background information for the AI model. This is crucial for guiding the AI to generate the desired output.

* **Welcome Message:** An optional message displayed to users when they interact with the prompt, providing additional context or instructions.
* **Conversation Starter(s):** Predefined text options that users can click to initiate a conversation or trigger a specific action when executing the prompt.
