# What is an Agent?

An agent is a virtual assistant that automates tasks and streamlines workflows. Unlike simple automation, agents can make decisions, adapt to changing conditions, and perform actions across multiple systems to achieve specific goals.

Key characteristics:

  - **Autonomous**: Operates independently with minimal supervision
  - **Proactive**: Determines next steps without explicit instructions
  - **Intelligent**: Uses AI to interpret instructions and make informed decisions

## Agents in ELITEA

ELITEA Agents are customizable virtual assistants that you create to handle specific tasks or workflows. Each agent combines instructions, toolkits, and integrations to perform complex actions like searching Google, creating Jira tickets, or managing GitHub repositories.

What makes ELITEA Agents powerful:

  - **Customizable**: Define instructions, scope, and complexity for each agent
  - **Integrated**: Connect with external toolkits and services seamlessly  
  - **Scalable**: Handle tasks across different domains and complexity levels
  - **Goal-oriented**: Work toward specific objectives rather than open-ended conversations

Perfect for automating repetitive tasks, processing information from multiple sources, and reducing manual effort while increasing productivity.

### Example

You configure Jira agent to:

 - Connect to Jira via your saved credentials
 - Search for issues with priority = High

Once configured, the agent will:

 1. Analyze the issues to identify blockers and dependencies
 2. Generates a simple summary: "3 high-priority items, 1 overdue (PROJ-123), 2 blocked waiting for design approval"
 3. Sends this summary to your Slack channel
