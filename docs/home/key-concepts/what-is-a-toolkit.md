# What is a Toolkit?

A toolkit is a collection of specialized tools and capabilities that extend what agents can do. Think of toolkits as skill sets that agents can use to interact with specific systems, services, or perform particular types of tasks.

Key characteristics:

- **Specialized**: Each toolkit focuses on a specific domain or service (e.g., Jira, GitHub, Slack)
- **Reusable**: Multiple agents can use the same toolkit for different purposes
- **Extensible**: Toolkits can be combined to create complex workflows across multiple systems
