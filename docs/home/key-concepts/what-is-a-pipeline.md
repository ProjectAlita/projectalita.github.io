# What is a Pipeline?


A pipeline is an automated workflow that connects multiple agents and processes in sequence to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. Think of pipelines as assembly lines where each stage performs a specific function, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next, creating sophisticated automated workflows.

## Pipelines in ELITEA

ELITEA Pipelines provide a way to orchestrate and automate complex business processes by chaining together multiple agents and toolkits, each with their own specialized capabilities. Each pipeline defines the flow of data and tasks through various stages, enabling sophisticated automation that would be difficult to achieve with individual agents alone.

Key characteristics:

- **Sequential Processing**: Execute tasks in a defined order with outputs feeding into subsequent stages
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Coordinate multiple agents and toolkits with different specialties in one workflow
- **Data Flow Management**: Automatically pass data and context between pipeline stages
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms for robust execution
- **Scalable**: Handle complex workflows that span multiple systems and processes
- **Configurable**: Customize pipeline stages, conditions, and branching logic
- **Monitored**: Track execution progress and performance across all pipeline stages

Perfect for complex business processes, multi-step automations, data processing workflows, and any scenario requiring coordinated execution across multiple specialized agents.


## Example: Documentation to Testing Pipeline

**Scenario**: Sarah automates the flow from Confluence documentation updates to Jira user stories and TestRail test cases.

**Pipeline Flow:**

**Agent 1: Documentation Reviewer**

 - **Confluence Toolkit** - Monitor documentation changes and extract requirements
 - **Output**: Structured requirements list with features and business rules

**Agent 2: User Story Creator**

- **Input**: Output from Agent 1
- **Jira Toolkit** - Create user stories with acceptance criteria from requirements
- **Output**: Jira user stories with IDs and acceptance criteria

**Agent 3: Test Case Generator**

- **Input**: Output from Agent 2
- **TestRail Toolkit** - Generate test cases linked to Jira stories
- **Output**: Complete test cases with traceability links

**Sample Output:**
> **Pipeline Result**: 1 Confluence update → 8 Jira user stories → 24 TestRail test cases
> 
> **Time Saved**: 2 days → 45 minutes

This pipeline ensures complete traceability from documentation to development-ready stories and test cases.
