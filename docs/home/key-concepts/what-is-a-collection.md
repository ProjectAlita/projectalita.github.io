# What is a Collection?


## Collections in ELITEA

A collection is an organized group of related agents and pipelines that can be managed, shared, and reused together. Think of collections as folders or libraries that help you keep your ELITEA agents and pipelines well-organized and easily accessible to your team.

ELITEA collections provide a structured way to manage your agents and pipelines. Each collection can include multiple agents and pipelines, allowing you to package complete workflows, share best practices, and maintain project-specific configurations efficiently.

Key characteristics:

- **Organized**: Group related agents and pipelines together for better management
