# Overview of ELITEA Platform

Step into ELITEA â€“ where creativity meets AI power. More than just another tool, ELITEA transforms how teams work with generative AI technology. We've built a vibrant workspace where your ideas take shape through intelligent agents, pipelines, and collections that automate complex workflows.

**Key Features:**

* **[Agents](../menus/agents.md)**: Build virtual assistants that handle specific tasks with precision. These digital teammates combine instructions, external toolkits, and integrations to perform complex actions - from searching the web to creating tickets in Jira - all driven by powerful language models.
* **[Pipelines](../menus/pipelines.md)**: Connect the dots with visual workflows that automate repetitive tasks. Design sequences of actions that handle decisions and integrate with your favorite toolkits, bringing consistency and efficiency to complex processes.
* **[Chat](../menus/chat.md)**: Experience AI conversations that just work. ELITEA Chat brings everything together - your agents, pipelines, and language models - in a natural interface where complex ideas flow effortlessly between human and machine.
* **[Collections](../menus/collections.md)**: Keep your digital workspace organized with custom collections. Group related agents and pipelines to focus on specific projects or themes without the clutter.
* **[Artifacts](../menus/artifacts.md)**: Share and store important files between agents with temporary storage buckets. Create, read, update, and delete text-based files that preserve context across operations, making your workflows smarter and more connected.
* **[Credentials](../menus/credentials.md)**: Securely manage authentication information for external services and integrations. Store API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data centrally for use across your agents and pipelines.
* **[Toolkits](../menus/toolkits.md)**: Create and manage custom toolkits that extend the capabilities of your agents and pipelines. Integrate with external services and add powerful functionality to your AI workflows.
* **[Extensions](../integrations/extensions/elitea-code.md)**: Transform how you write code with ELITEA extensions for VS Code and IntelliJ. Get intelligent suggestions, automate routine coding tasks, and adapt your development environment to your unique style.
* **Advanced Creation Tools**: Build sophisticated solutions using variables, instructions, conversation starters, and specialized tools that extend what's possible with AI.
* **[Powerful Search](../features/search-entities.md)**: Find exactly what you need with robust search capabilities. Locate agents, pipelines, collections, toolkits, and credentials by tags, names, or descriptions in seconds.
* **[Platform Management](../menus/settings/settings-overview.md)**: Handle the practical side of AI deployment with tools for [importing/exporting](../features/export-import.md), managing credentials, setting up [credentials](../how-tos/how-to-use-credentials.md), and organizing [users and projects](../features/roles.md) - all through an intuitive interface.
* **[Community Engagement](../features/public-project.md)**: Share your best work and discover what others have created. Publish, modify, and collaborate on agents, pipelines, and collections to build a vibrant ecosystem of AI solutions.
