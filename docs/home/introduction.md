# Overview of ELITEA Platform

Step into ELITEA – where creativity meets AI power. More than just another tool, ELITEA transforms how teams work with generative AI technology. We've built a vibrant workspace where your ideas take shape through intelligent agents, and pipelines that automate complex workflows.

**Key Features:**

* **[Agents](../menus/agents.md)**: Build virtual assistants that handle specific tasks with precision. These digital teammates combine instructions, external toolkits, and integrations to perform complex actions - from searching the web to creating tickets in Jira - all driven by powerful language models.
* **[Pipelines](../menus/pipelines.md)**: Connect the dots with visual workflows that automate repetitive tasks. Design sequences of actions that handle decisions and integrate with your favorite toolkits, bringing consistency and efficiency to complex processes.
* **[Chat](../menus/chat.md)**: Experience AI conversations that just work. ELITEA Chat brings everything together - your agents, pipelines, and language models - in a natural interface where complex ideas flow effortlessly between human and machine.
* **[Artifacts](../menus/artifacts.md)**: Share and store important files between agents with temporary storage buckets. Create, read, update, and delete text-based files that preserve context across operations, making your workflows smarter and more connected.
* **[Credentials](../menus/credentials.md)**: Securely manage authentication information for external services and integrations. Store API keys, tokens, and other sensitive data centrally for use across your agents and pipelines.
* **[Toolkits](../menus/toolkits.md)**: Create and manage custom toolkits that extend the capabilities of your agents and pipelines. Integrate with external services and add powerful functionality to your AI workflows.
* **[Indexing](../how-tos/indexing/indexing-overview.md)**: Turn your documents and connected knowledge sources into searchable indexes. Use indexing to power semantic search and retrieval, so agents and pipelines can work with grounded context instead of relying only on conversation history.
* **[MCPs (Local and Remote)](../menus/mcps.md)**: Connect ELITEA to MCP servers to extend what agents and pipelines can access. Use **local MCPs** (running on your machine) or **remote MCPs** (hosted services) to bring additional tools and context into your workflows.
* **[Extensions](../integrations/extensions/elitea-code.md)**: Transform how you write code with ELITEA extensions for VS Code and IntelliJ. Get intelligent suggestions, automate routine coding tasks, and adapt your development environment to your unique style.
* **Advanced Creation Tools**: Build sophisticated solutions using variables, instructions, conversation starters, and specialized tools that extend what's possible with AI.
* **[Powerful Search](../how-tos/entity-management/search-entities.md)**: Find exactly what you need with robust search capabilities. Locate agents, pipelines, toolkits, and credentials by tags, names, or descriptions in seconds.
* **[Platform Management](../menus/settings/settings-overview.md)**: Handle the practical side of AI deployment with tools for [importing/exporting](../features/export-import.md), managing credentials, setting up [credentials](../how-tos/credentials-toolkits/how-to-use-credentials.md), and organizing [users and projects](../how-tos/entity-management/manage-users-and-roles.md) - all through an intuitive interface.
* **[Community Engagement](../features/public-project.md)**: Share your best work and discover what others have created. Publish, modify, and collaborate on agents, pipelines, and to build a vibrant ecosystem of AI solutions.

ELITEA puts powerful AI capabilities in your hands without the complexity. Whether you're developing code, creating content, or managing data-driven projects, you'll find the tools you need to succeed right here.
