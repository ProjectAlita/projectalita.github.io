# Overview of ELITEA Platform

Step into ELITEA â€“ where creativity meets AI power. More than just another tool, ELITEA transforms how teams work with generative AI technology. We've built a vibrant workspace where your ideas take shape through prompts, datasources, intelligent agents and pipelines that automate complex workflows.

**Key Features:**

* **[Agents](../platform-documentation/menus/agents.md)**: Build virtual assistants that handle specific tasks with precision. These digital teammates combine prompts, datasources, and external tools to perform complex actions - from searching the web to creating tickets in Jira - all driven by powerful language models.
* **[Pipelines](../platform-documentation/menus/pipelines.md)**: Connect the dots with visual workflows that automate repetitive tasks. Design sequences of actions that handle decisions and integrate with your favorite toolkits, bringing consistency and efficiency to complex processes.
* **[Prompts](../platform-documentation/menus/prompts.md)**: Craft instructions that guide AI models to deliver exactly what you need. With version tracking built in, you'll always have access to your most effective prompts when inspiration strikes.
* **[Datasources](../platform-documentation/menus/datasources.md)**: Feed your AI what matters most by connecting your own specialized data. Enrich language model responses with context that's relevant to your projects, making every interaction more precise and valuable.
* **[Chat](../platform-documentation/menus/chat.md)**: Experience AI conversations that just work. ELITEA Chat brings everything together - your agents, pipelines, prompts and datasources, and language models - in a natural interface where complex ideas flow effortlessly between human and machine.
* **[Collections](../platform-documentation/menus/collections.md)**: Keep your digital workspace organized with custom collections. Group related prompts, agents, pipelines and datasources to focus on specific projects or themes without the clutter.
* **[Artifacts](../platform-documentation/menus/artifacts.md)**: Share and store important files between agents with temporary storage buckets. Create, read, update, and delete text-based files that preserve context across operations, making your workflows smarter and more connected.
* **[Extensions](../platform-documentation/extensions/alita-code.md)**: Transform how you write code with Elitea extensions for VS Code and IntelliJ. Get intelligent suggestions, automate routine coding tasks, and adapt your development environment to your unique style.
* **[Execution with Precision](../how-tos/creating-prompts.md)**: Take control of how your prompts run with fine-tuned model selection and parameters. Adjust temperature, tokens, and other settings to match exactly what your task demands.
* **[Advanced Creation Tools](../feature-guides/core-features/prompt-magic-assistant.md)**: Build sophisticated solutions using variables, system prompts, assistant messages, and specialized tools that extend what's possible with AI.
* **[Powerful Search](..//how-tos/how-to-search.md)**: Find exactly what you need with robust search capabilities. Locate prompts, agents, data sources, and pipelines by tags, names, or descriptions in seconds.
* **[Platform Management](../platform-documentation/menus/settings.md)**: Handle the practical side of AI deployment with tools for [importing/exporting](../feature-guides/core-features/export-import.md), managing secrets, setting up [integrations](../feature-guides/core-features/integrations.md), and organizing [users and projects](../feature-guides/advanced-features/roles.md) - all through an intuitive interface.
* **[Community Engagement](../feature-guides/core-features/public-project.md)**: Share your best work and discover what others have created. Publish, modify, and collaborate on prompts, agents, and pipelines to build a vibrant ecosystem of AI solutions.

ELITEA puts powerful AI capabilities in your hands without the complexity. Whether you're developing code, creating content, or managing data-driven projects, you'll find the tools you need to succeed right here.
