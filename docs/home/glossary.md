**Top K**
: A parameter that limits the AI model's word selection to the K most likely next tokens at each step. For example, Top K = 40 means the model only considers the 40 most probable next words. Lower values create more focused responses, while higher values allow for more diversity in word choice.

**Top P (0.1 - 1.0)**
: Also known as nucleus sampling, this parameter controls response diversity by considering only the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the P threshold. For example, Top P = 0.9 means the model considers the most likely tokens that together account for 90% of the probability mass. Lower values produce more focused responses, while higher values allow for more creativity.

**Transition**
: The connections between nodes in a pipeline that define the flow of execution and how steps connect to each other in automated workflows.
