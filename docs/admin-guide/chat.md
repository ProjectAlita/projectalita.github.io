# Conversations

ELITEA Chat is an ultimate feature, allowing you to combine all ELITEA features in one place and achieve the best output and results.

In the ELITEA framework, a conversation is a dialogue among various participants such as selected language models, prompts, datasources, agents, and human users. The chat uses natural language to interact with a human and receive/give feedback. Within one conversation, you can refer to previous questions and answers. However, different conversations donâ€™t share context.

All your conversations are stored on the ELITEA server, and you can access them from any device you use. All your conversations are accessible from the **Chat** menu.

Conversations support the following functionality:

* **Public and Private Conversations**: Share your conversation with other users from your project, involve them in the same conversation, or keep it private and visible only to you.
* **Participants**: Add various participants to the conversation, including other users in public conversations, prompts, data sources, agents, and language models, making them part of the conversation.
* **Interactions**: Interact with added participants, copy generated responses, and more.
* **Managing Conversations**: Save conversations, pin the most important ones at the top of the screen, make private conversations public, delete conversations, clean the content of the conversation, and export the context of the conversation.
* **Playback**: During playback, you can move backward and forward through the playback process or stop the conversation by simulating the current conversation without any engagement with models.

## Creating a Conversation

3. After creating Conversation add partiicpants to the conversation by clicking the **PARTICIPANTS +** button.

Your newly created conversation will subsequently appear on the Conversation's list.

## Private and Public Conversations

Private conversations are only visible to the user who created them. You can add all available participants to your project and use this conversation. You can also make private conversations public later.
**Note**: By default, all conversations created in a Private project will be Private as you can't invite/share such conversations with other users.

Public conversations are visible to all users of the same project. Those users can also interact in the public conversations, add/remove their participants, delete conversations, copy messages, etc.
**Note**: Users can't convert public conversations back to private.

## Participants

Participants are additional "tools" that can be added to the conversation to enhance it. The following types of participants are available:

* **Models**: LLM models which can be added to the conversation to interact with Gen AI and get responses from the selected model.
* **Prompts**: Already created prompts within the project or public ones which can be added to the conversation to execute them and get responses.
* **Datasources**: Already created datasources within the project or public ones which can be added to the conversation to execute them and get responses.
* **Agents**: Already created agents within the project or public ones which can be added to the conversation to execute them and get responses.

**Note**: Another category of participant is the user, which can't be added, but in the case of public conversations, users within the project can follow the conversation, interact with it, and thus become participants.

### How to Add a Participant

1. Click the **Add participants** button if you just created a conversation or **+** icon next to **PARTICIPANTS**.

### How to Use a Participant

1. Check that the participant is selected and added to the conversation.

      * You can either click on the required participant option from the **PARTICIPANTS** section.
      * Or you can call the required participant from the "Type your message" input box by typing **/** - prompt, **#** - data source, **@** - agent, **>** - model. Then select it from the dropdown list.
3. After adding the active participant to the conversation, you can use it by typing simple commands like "Go", "Start Generating", "Execute", or "Run it" and click the **Send** icon to execute the participant.
4. To remove the participant from the conversation's active participant list, click the X icon. Note: This will not remove the participant from the Conversation entirely. You can call it again.
