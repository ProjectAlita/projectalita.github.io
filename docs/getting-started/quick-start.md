!!! info "Important"
     First-time users need to wait for project setup. The **Private** project is provisioned automatically.

1. **Be Patient**: Allow up to **5 minutes** for your **Private** project to be created automatically.
2. **Initial View**: You'll start in the **Public** project view during this initialization period.
3. **Check Status**: You'll know your **Private** project is ready when you can switch from **Public** to **Private** using the project switcher.

---

## Step 3: Switch to Your Private Project

1. **Locate Project Switcher**: Find the **Smart Drawer's Project Switcher** in the top left corner of the interface.
2. **Switch Projects**: Change from **Public** to **Private** once your project initialization is complete.
3. **Confirm Switch**: You should now see your private workspace where you can create and manage your own assets.

### Understanding Project Types

**Private Project**: Your personal workspace where only you have access to create and manage credentials, toolkits, agents, pipelines and collections.

**Team Projects**: If you're invited to team projects, you'll see them in the project switcher. Team projects enable:

* Collaborative workspaces with shared resources
* Role-based access (viewer, editor, admin, system)
* Shared conversations with teammate collaboration
* Real-time collaborative editing in Chat Canvas
* Shared credentials, toolkits, agents, pipelines, and collections for team use

**Public Project**: A community space to explore and learn from other users' shared content.

## Step 4: Generate a Personal Access Token

Before creating agents and toolkits, you'll need a personal token for secure access:

1. **Navigate to Settings:** 
    * Click the ELITEA icon in the top left to open the sidebar
    * Select **Settings** from the menu
2. **Access Personal Tokens**: Choose **Personal Tokens** from the Settings submenu.
3. **Create New Token:**
    * Click the **`+` icon** to create a new token
    * Enter a descriptive **name** (e.g., "My Development Token")
    * Set an **expiration date** for security
    * Click **Generate**
4. **Copy and Store:** **Immediately copy the token** and store it securely. This is the only time you'll see the full token value.
5. **Configure Integration:** (Optional):
    * Select your preferred **Integration Option** from the dropdown (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-4o)
    * Download VS Code or JetBrains settings if you plan to use code extensions

     * Optionally add a **description** explaining what this secret is for
     * Click **Save**
4. **Secure Storage**: Your secret is now encrypted and stored securely for use in credentials and toolkits.

!!! info "Important"
     Secrets are write-only for security. Once saved, you cannot view the actual value again, only reference it by name.
