2. Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, and **Context** fields.
3. Click **Save**.

**Note**: **Name** and **Description** are non-editable fields and can't be modified after saving the prompt.

![Prompt-Create_New_Prompt](img/Prompt-Create_New_Prompt.png)

### How to Create Tags

In the Prompt Library application, Tags serve as an efficient organizational tool that allows you to categorize and manage your collection of prompts. By assigning relevant tags to each prompt, you create an intuitive labeling system that facilitates quick access and retrieval. Later on, you can filter prompts by these tags, simplifying the process of finding the precise prompt you need among a vast collection, which is especially useful for users with an extensive library of different prompt types and topics.

### How to Setup Messages

The MESSAGES section is a crucial component that allows users to structure the flow of interaction within a prompt.

* "**System**" message - a system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to LLM, such as specifying a particular goal or role for LLM before asking it a question or giving it a task.
* "**Assistant**" message - an Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries
* "**User**" message, on the other hand, exemplifies what a real human user might say or ask within a given scenario.

To enhance the interactivity of a prompt, user can add multiple messages of any type by clicking the + icon, selecting the desired message type, and providing the relevant content.
Additionally, user have the ability to delete, copy, and reorder messages to best fit the flow of the conversation, easily arranging them by dragging and dropping the message boxes as needed for optimal organization and presentation.


![Prompt-System_Messages](img/Prompt-System_Messages.png)

### How to Use Variables

The variables within prompts add a layer of dynamic customization, allowing you to tailor prompts to specific needs or contexts.

**Variables** are denoted by double curly brackets (e.g., {{variable_name}}) and should be defined in the prompt's Context input box. Once a variable is entered into the CONTEXT, it automatically populates the VARIABLES section, where you can assign a value to that variable. This feature empowers users to create flexible and reusable prompts that can be easily adapted by changing the values of the variables as needed, without altering the entire prompt structure.

**Note**: User has the flexibility to define one or more variables in each prompt. Variables can also be defined in **Messages**.

![Prompt-Create_Variables](img/Prompt-Create_Variables.png)


### How to Execute Prompt

To execute the prompt and get the output you have 2 options:

* **Chat** - is a specific type of input designed for conversational AI models, which aims to initiate or guide a dialogue. This can be in the form of a question, statement, or command that simulates human-like interaction, prompting the AI to produce a conversational response for engagement.
* **Completion** - is supplied to generative AI models, such as text or code generators, with the intent of the model continuing or completing the given input. The AI uses the context provided in the prompt to produce a coherent and contextually relevant extension or completion of the text.

#### Executing a Prompt Using the **Chat** Option:

1. **Configure the Prompt**: Initialize by providing the necessary context, identifying the prompt with a name, and defining variable values (if applicable).
2. **Select the AI Model**: Choose the appropriate AI model (e.g., gpt-4-0125-preview, gpt-35-turbo, etc.).
3. **Set the Temperature Parameter**: Adjust this parameter to control the level of creativity or unpredictability in responses.
