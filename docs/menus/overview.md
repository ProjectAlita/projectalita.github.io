### General Navigation and Management Across the Platform

This section provides an overview of the common functionalities and actions available across various menus and pages within the platform. The aim is to ensure a consistent and efficient user experience by maintaining uniformity in navigation and management features across **Private**, **Team** and **Public** projects.

#### **Private** and **Team** projects navigation

In **Private** and **Team** projects you work with the same core menus listed below. In a **Private** project the content is visible only to you. In a **Team** project the entities (conversations, agents, pipelines, etc.) are shared and collaboratively manageable by the team members according to their permissions. The functional menus are:

* **Chat** menu: Access all your private and public conversations, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration.
* **Agents** menu: View and manage all the agents you have created, each designed to perform specific tasks using external tools.
* **Pipelines** menu: Access and manage all the pipelines you have created, design and automate workflows by connecting various nodes, such as conditions, decisions, loops, and tool integrations.
* **Credentials** menu: Manage authentication credentials for external services and integrations used by your agents and pipelines.
* **Toolkits** menu: Create and manage custom toolkits that can be used across different agents and pipelines to extend functionality.
* **MCPs** menu: Manage external MCP servers connected to your project via the Elitea MCP Client. Create MCP entries, monitor their Connected/Disconnected state, enable the tools you need, and use them across agents, pipelines, and conversations.
* **Collections** menu: Manage your collections of agents and pipelines, organized for specific projects or themes.
* **Artifacts** menu: Utilize the Artifacts feature to create Buckets in ELITEA for saving, updating (appending), reading, and deleting files. Artifacts serve as a temporary file storage solution, enhancing your project's data management capabilities.

#### **Public** project navigation

In a **Public** project, you can engage with the community and explore content created by other users through the following sections:

* **Chat** menu: Engage in public conversations, explore shared discussions, and collaborate with the community by adding participants from published agents, pipelines, and other community resources.
* **Agents** menu: Navigate through the Latest agents, explore agents you've liked (My Likes), and discover Trending agents within the community.
* **Pipelines** menu: Discover the Latest pipelines, explore pipelines you've liked (My Likes), and find Trending pipelines shared by the community.
* **Credentials** menu: View credential definitions that have been intentionally published for community reuse (e.g., demo or shared integration keys). Private / sensitive credentials remain restricted and are never exposed in Public projects.
* **Toolkits** menu: Discover publicly shared toolkits that bundle reusable actions or integrations you can leverage in your own agents and pipelines.
* **Collections** menu: Explore the Latest collections, view collections you've liked (My Likes), and discover Trending collections that are gaining attention.
* **Artifacts** menu: Access publicly shared artifact buckets or files generated by published agents and pipelines (read-only). Use them to review outputs, sample data sets, or reference materials shared with the community.

While the context may vary depending on the specific page you're viewing, the core principles of action and functionality remain consistent. This unified approach ensures that whether you are navigating a private or public project, the experience is intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating effective management and exploration of content within the platform.
