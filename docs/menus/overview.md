#### **Private** and **Team** projects navigation

In **Private** and **Team** projects you work with the same core menus listed below. In a **Private** project the content is visible only to you.

* **Chat** menu: Access all your private and public conversations, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration.
* **Agents** menu: View and manage all the agents you have created, each designed to perform specific tasks using external tools.
* **Pipelines** menu: Access and manage all the pipelines you have created, design and automate workflows by connecting various nodes, such as conditions, decisions, loops, and tool integrations.
* **Credentials** menu: Manage authentication credentials for external services and integrations used by your agents and pipelines.
* **Toolkits** menu: Create and manage custom toolkits that can be used across different agents and pipelines to extend functionality.

* **Collections** menu: Manage your collections of agents and pipelines, organized for specific projects or themes.
* **Artifacts** menu: Utilize the Artifacts feature to create Buckets in ELITEA for saving, updating (appending), reading, and deleting files. Artifacts serve as a temporary file storage solution, enhancing your project's data management capabilities.
