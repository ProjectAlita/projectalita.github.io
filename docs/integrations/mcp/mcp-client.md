# Elitea MCP Client Integration via STDIO

## Overview

The Elitea platform offers powerful bidirectional integration capabilities through its MCP Client functionality, allowing you to connect external MCP servers to extend Elitea's capabilities with specialized tools and services. This integration enables Elitea to act as an MCP Client, connecting to and orchestrating multiple external MCP servers such as Playwright for browser automation and GitHub for repository management.

Using Standard Input/Output (STDIO) transport, Elitea can communicate with various MCP servers, making it an ideal orchestration platform for complex workflows that require integration with multiple external services. Whether you're automating web testing with Playwright or managing GitHub repositories, this guide will walk you through setting up and leveraging Elitea's MCP Client capabilities.

## What is the MCP Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication between AI-powered tools, agents, and client applications. By following the MCP protocol, different systems can exchange context, tasks, and results in a consistent and interoperable way.

MCP is widely adopted in the AI ecosystem, making it easier to integrate various tools and platforms with AI agents. Elitea's implementation allows it to act as both an MCP Server (providing agents as tools) and an MCP Client (connecting to external MCP servers).

To learn more about the technical details and capabilities of MCP, visit the official documentation: [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## Architecture and Communication Flow

### Elitea as an MCP Client

When Elitea acts as an MCP Client, it establishes connections to external MCP servers and makes their tools available to Elitea agents and workflows. This creates a powerful ecosystem where Elitea can orchestrate complex multi-tool workflows.

```
┌─────────────────┐    STDIO      ┌──────────────────┐
│  Elitea Agent   │◄─────────────►│ Playwright MCP   │
│                 │               │ Server           │
└─────────────────┘               └──────────────────┘
         │
         │ STDIO
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐               ┌──────────────────┐
│ GitHub MCP      │◄─────────────►│ Other MCP        │
│ Server          │    STDIO      │ Servers          │
└─────────────────┘               └──────────────────┘
```

### Stateful & Stateless Sessions – Flexible Server Connection Modes

Elitea supports both **stateful** and **stateless** session modes when connecting to external MCP servers:

- **Stateful sessions** keep a persistent connection open, allowing context and data to be shared across multiple tool calls. This is ideal for workflows that require continuity, such as browser automation, multi-step testing, or working with sessions that need to remember previous actions.

- **Stateless sessions** start fresh for each tool call, ensuring a clean environment every time. This is best for simple, independent operations where you want to avoid any leftover state or side effects between runs.

You can choose the mode that fits your workflow best—stateful for complex, ongoing tasks, or stateless for isolated, repeatable actions. Configuration is simple and can be set per server in your Elitea MCP Client settings.

### Key Benefits

- **Multi-tool Orchestration**: Connect multiple specialized MCP servers simultaneously
- **Stateful Session Management**: Maintain persistent connections for complex workflows  
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Elitea can both provide and consume MCP services
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new capabilities by connecting additional MCP servers

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Elitea as an MCP Client, ensure you have the following:

- **Elitea Project Access**  
  You'll need access to an Elitea project with the ability to configure MCP client connections. Contact your Elitea administrator if you need project access.

- **Authentication Token**  
  An authentication token is required to configure the MCP client connections. You can generate and manage tokens in the Elitea web interface under the [Settings & Configuration – Personal Tokens](../../menus/settings/personal-tokens.md) section.

- **External MCP Servers**  
  You'll need access to the external MCP servers you want to connect (e.g., Playwright MCP, GitHub MCP). Each server may have its own authentication requirements.

- **Project Configuration Access**  
  The ability to modify your Elitea project's MCP client configuration, typically done through the Elitea web interface or configuration files.

### How to Create an MCP in Elitea

Create the MCP entry in the ELITEA UI so your project can reference and use the external server.

1. Ensure the **Elitea MCP Client** is installed and started.
2. Open the **MCPs** menu.
3. Select the **available MCP servers** you want to add after they are running locally and connected to your project.
4. Click **`+ Create`**.
5. Fill in details:
      * **Name:** Clear, descriptive label (e.g., "Playwright Browser Automation").
      * **Description:** Optional purpose note.
6. Review the **Tools** list and unselect anything not needed (least privilege).
7. Click **Save**.

![Create MCP Placeholder](../../img/menus/mcps/mcps_create.png)

!!! tip "Disconnected Creation"
  If the MCP Client is not running at creation time, tool discovery may be empty. Start the client and refresh the MCP entry to load tools.

For more UI details, see the [MCPs menu guide](../../menus/mcps.md).

### How to Add MCP Server as a Toolkit to an Agent

1. **Navigate to Elitea** and select the project where you have configured MCP servers.
2. **Create a new agent** or select an existing one.
      1. Go to the **Configuration** tab of the agent.
      2. Scroll down to the **Toolkits** section.
      3. Click **+MCP**.
      4. Your configured MCP server(s) will appear in the list, using the names you set during setup.
          ![Select MCP Server Toolkit](../../img/integrations/mcp/select-mcp-toolkit.png)
      5. Select the desired MCP server as a toolkit.
      6. Review and select the suggested tools for that toolkit. By default, all tools are selected.
         ![Select Tools for Toolkit](../../img/integrations/mcp/select-mcp-tools.png)
3.  Click **Save** to apply the toolkit to the agent.
4.  Configure the agent’s settings, instructions, etc., and save your changes.

You can now use the MCP server’s tools directly from Elitea—triggering actions, automations, or integrations as part of your agent’s workflow.

### Project and User Scope Notes


* **Private Project Setup:**
     * If you set up an MCP server in your Private project, it becomes available in your Private project and in all "Team" projects where you are a member. However, only you will see and be able to use these MCP servers.
* **Team Project Setup:**
     * If you set up an MCP server in a Team project, it becomes available to all users of that Team project, as well as in your Private project and any other Team projects you are involved in. Still, only you will see and be able to use the MCP servers you configured.

!!! tip "Tip"
    This ensures your MCP integrations are both flexible and secure—available where you need them, but only visible to you unless shared in a Team project.

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" error

**Problem:**
After clicking the **Start MCP Server** option in tray app to start the server. you encounter an error stating that the MCP server is not found or could not be started.
     ![Incorrect config.json](../../img/integrations/mcp/mcp-config-empty-terminal.png)

**Solution:**
This issue typically occurs when the `servers` configuration is missing or empty in your `config.json` file. This can happen if the `bootstrap` process was interrupted or conflicted with another program (like Visual Studio Code) that had the file open.

   ![Incorrect config.json](../../img/integrations/mcp/mcp-config-empty.png)

1.  **Locate your `config.json` file.** (See "Configuration File Locations" section for paths).
2.  **Open the file** and inspect the `"servers"` object. If it's empty (`"servers": {}`) or missing, you need to add the server configuration manually.
3.  **Add the server configuration.** You can re-run `alita-mcp bootstrap` or copy the server object manually. The configuration for a server should look like this:

    ![Correct config.json](../../img/integrations/mcp/mcp-config-filled.png)

    Here is an example of a correctly filled-in `playwright` server configuration:

```json
{
  "deployment_url": "https://next.elitea.ai",
  "auth_token": "eyJhbGciOi.....",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8000,
  "project_id": 6,
  "servers": {
    "Playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ],
      "stateful": true
    }
  }
}
```

 **Save the `config.json` file** and try running the MCP client again.
