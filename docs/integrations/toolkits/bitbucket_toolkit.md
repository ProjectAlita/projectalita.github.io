## BitBucket Account Setup and Configuration

### Account Setup

If you don't have a Bitbucket account yet, hereâ€™s how to get started:

1.  **Go to Bitbucket:** Open your web browser and navigate to [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org).
2.  **Sign Up for Free:** Click the **"Sign up for Free"** button.
3.  **Enter Your Email:** Provide your email address. **For professional use, it's highly recommended to use your company email.**
4.  **Create Your Account:** Follow the prompts to set up your account, including entering your name and creating a secure password.
5.  **Verify Your Email:** Check your inbox for a verification email from Bitbucket and click the verification link to activate your account.
6.  **Log In:** Once verified, log in to Bitbucket with your new credentials.

### Token/API Key Generation: Creating an App Password in Bitbucket

For secure integration with ELITEA, we strongly recommend using a Bitbucket **App Password**. This method is more secure than using your primary account password directly and allows you to control the permissions granted to ELITEA.

**Follow these steps to create an App Password:**

1.  **Log in to Bitbucket:** Access your Bitbucket account at [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org).
2.  **Access Personal Settings:** Click on your profile avatar in the bottom left corner and select **"Personal settings"**.
3.  **Navigate to App Passwords:** In the left-hand menu under "Security," click on **"App passwords"**.
4.  **Create App Password:** Click the **"Create app password"** button.
5.  **Name the App Password:** In the "Label" field, enter a descriptive name like "ELITEA Integration" to easily identify its purpose.
6.  **Define Permissions - Grant Least Privilege:**  This is crucial for security. **Carefully select only the necessary permissions** for ELITEA to interact with Bitbucket.  For typical ELITEA integration, consider these minimal permissions:
    *   **Account permissions:**
        *   **Account:** Read
    *   **Project permissions:**
        *   **Projects:** Read
    *   **Repository permissions:**
        *   **Repository:** Read
        *   **Repository:** Write (Only if your Agent needs to modify repositories, e.g., create files, branches, or pull requests)
        *   **Pull requests:** Write (If your Agent will create pull requests)
        *   **Issues:** Read (If your Agent needs to access issues)
        *   **Wiki:** Read (If your Agent needs to read wiki content)

    **Security Best Practice:**  **Avoid granting "Admin" or any unnecessary permissions.** Limiting permissions significantly reduces potential security risks.

7.  **Create Password:** Click **"Create"** by using the following [link](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).
8.  **Securely Store Your App Password:** **Immediately copy the generated App Password.** This is the only time it will be displayed in full. Store it securely using a password manager or ELITEA's built-in Secrets feature (recommended for enhanced security within ELITEA). You will need this App Password to configure the Bitbucket toolkit in ELITEA.
