## Instructions and Prompts for Using the Jira Toolkit

To effectively instruct your ELITEA Agent to use the Jira toolkit, you need to provide clear and precise instructions within the Agent's "Instructions" field. These instructions are crucial for guiding the Agent on *when* and *how* to utilize the available Jira tools to achieve your desired automation goals.

### Instruction Creation for OpenAI Agents

When crafting instructions for the Jira toolkit, especially for OpenAI-based Agents, clarity and precision are paramount. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simple, actionable steps. Explicitly define all parameters required for each tool and guide the Agent on how to obtain or determine the values for these parameters. OpenAI Agents respond best to instructions that are:

*   **Direct and Action-Oriented:** Employ strong action verbs and clear commands to initiate actions. For example, "Use the 'search_using_jql' tool...", "Create an issue with...", "Update issue with key...".

*   **Parameter-Centric:** Clearly enumerate each parameter required by the tool. For each parameter, specify:
    *   Its name (exactly as expected by the tool)
    *   The format or type of value expected
    *   How the Agent should obtain the value – whether from user input, derived from previous steps in the conversation, retrieved from an external source, or a predefined static value

*   **Contextually Rich:** Provide sufficient context so the Agent understands the overarching objective and the specific scenario in which each Jira tool should be applied within the broader workflow. Explain the desired outcome or goal for each tool invocation.

*   **Step-by-Step Structure:** Organize instructions into a numbered or bulleted list of steps for complex workflows. This helps the Agent follow a logical sequence of actions.

*   **Add Conversation Starters:** Include example conversation starters that users can use to trigger this functionality. For example, "Conversation Starters: 'Create a new bug issue', 'Search for issues assigned to me', 'What's the status of project tasks?'"

When instructing your Agent to use a Jira toolkit tool, adhere to this structured pattern:

1. **State the Goal:** Begin by clearly stating the objective you want to achieve with this step. For example, "Goal: To find all open issues assigned to the current user."

2. **Specify the Tool:** Clearly indicate the specific Jira tool to be used for this step. For example, "Tool: Use the 'search_using_jql' tool."

3. **Define Parameters:** Provide a detailed list of all parameters required by the selected tool. For each parameter:
   - **Parameter Name:** `<Parameter Name as defined in tool documentation>`
   - **Value or Source:** `<Specify the value or how to obtain the value. Examples: "user input", "from previous step", "hardcoded value 'PROJECT-123'", "value of variable X">`

4. **Describe Expected Outcome (Optional but Recommended):** Briefly describe the expected result or outcome after the tool is successfully executed. For example, "Outcome: The Agent will provide a list of all open issues assigned to the user."

5. **Add Conversation Starters:** Include example conversation starters that users can use to trigger this functionality.

#### Example Agent Instructions

**Agent Instructions for Searching Issues using JQL:**

```markdown
1. Goal: Search for Jira issues using JQL to find specific issues based on user criteria.
2. Tool: Use the "search_using_jql" tool.
3. Parameters:
    - JQL Query: "Ask the user for search criteria or use predefined JQL like 'project = PROJECT AND status = \"In Progress\" AND assignee = currentUser()'"
4. Outcome: The Agent will provide a list of issues matching the JQL criteria.
5. Conversation Starters: 'Show me my open issues', 'Find all bugs in the project', 'Search for high priority tasks'
```

**Agent Instructions for Creating a New Issue:**

```markdown
1. Goal: Create a new issue in Jira based on user requirements.
2. Tool: Use the "create_issue" tool.
3. Parameters:
    - Issue JSON: "Collect required information from user (summary, description, issue type, priority) and format as JSON"
4. Outcome: The Agent will create a new issue and provide the issue key and URL.
5. Conversation Starters: 'Create a new bug report', 'Add a task to the project', 'Report a new issue'

```

*   **Tool-Specific Parameter Errors:**
    *   **Problem:** Agent execution fails for specific Jira tools due to incorrect parameter values or formats.
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        1.  **Verify Project Keys:** Ensure that you are using the correct Jira Project Keys in your Agent's instructions. Project Keys are case-sensitive and must exactly match the project keys in your Jira instance. Use the "List projects" tool to verify project keys if needed.
        2.  **Verify Issue Keys:** Double-check that you are using the correct Jira Issue Keys when referencing specific issues in your Agent's instructions. Issue Keys are case-sensitive and must match the issue keys in Jira exactly (e.g., "DEMO-123", "PROJECT-456").
        3.  **Parameter Format:** Verify that you are providing parameters in the correct format expected by each Jira tool (e.g., string values for names, numerical values for IDs, JSON format for issue updates). Refer to the "Instructions and Prompts for Using the Toolkit" section for parameter details and examples.
        4.  **Custom Fields:** If you are using custom fields in your Agent instructions, ensure that you have added the correct **Additional Fields** IDs in the toolkit's "Advanced Settings" and that you are using the correct custom field IDs and values in your Agent instructions. Use the "Get specific field info" tool to verify custom field IDs and values if needed.

*   **Toolkit Configuration Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** The toolkit fails to load or shows configuration errors after creation.
    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        1.  **Verify Credential Selection:** Ensure you have selected the correct credential from the dropdown in the toolkit configuration.
        2.  **Check Hosting Option:** Verify that the hosting option matches your Jira instance type (Cloud for *.atlassian.net, Server for self-hosted instances).
        3.  **Review Advanced Settings:** Check that custom field IDs and other advanced settings are properly formatted.

### FAQ

1.  **Q: Can I use my regular Jira password for the ELITEA integration?**
    *   **A:** **While ELITEA supports password authentication, using a Jira API token is strongly recommended for security.** API tokens provide a significantly more secure and controlled method for granting access to external applications like ELITEA, without exposing your primary account credentials. You can configure this in the credential's authentication method selection.

2.  **Q: What permissions are absolutely necessary for the Jira API token to work with ELITEA?**
    *   **A:** Jira API tokens have a fixed scope and provide access to the Jira REST API. The specific permissions depend on what your ELITEA Agent will be doing. For basic read-only access (e.g., using `search_using_jql`, `list_projects`), standard API access is sufficient. For modifications (e.g., `create_issue`, `update_issue`), ensure your Jira account has write permissions to the target projects. **Always adhere to the principle of least privilege and grant only the permissions that are strictly necessary for your Agent's intended functionalities.**

3.  **Q: What is the correct format for the Jira URL in the ELITEA credential configuration?**
    *   **A:** The Jira URL should be entered as the base URL without the `/jira` suffix (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net` for Cloud or `https://jira.epam.com` for Server). Ensure there are no typos or missing parts in the URL.

4.  **Q: How do I switch from the old Agent-based configuration to the new Credentials + Toolkit workflow?**
    *   **A:** The new workflow is: (1) Create a Jira credential with your authentication details, (2) Create a Jira toolkit that uses this credential, and (3) Add the toolkit to your agents, pipelines, or chat. This provides better security, reusability, and organization compared to configuring authentication directly in agents.

5.  **Q: Can I use the same Jira credential across multiple toolkits and agents?**
    *   **A:** Yes! This is one of the key benefits of the new workflow. Once you create a Jira credential, you can reuse it across multiple Jira toolkits, and each toolkit can be used by multiple agents, pipelines, and chat sessions. This promotes better credential management and reduces duplication.

6.  **Q: Why am I consistently encountering "Permission Denied" errors, even though I believe I have configured everything correctly?**
    *   **A:** If you are still facing "Permission Denied" errors despite careful configuration, systematically re-examine the following:
        *   **API Token Validity:** Double-check that the **API token** is still valid and has not been revoked in your Atlassian account settings.
        *   **Jira Account Permissions:** Explicitly verify that the Jira account associated with the API token has the necessary access rights to the *specific target projects* within Jira itself. Confirm project membership, permissions, and assigned roles within the Jira project settings.
        *   **Hosting Option Match:** Double-check that you have selected the correct "Hosting option" (Cloud or Server) in the toolkit configuration, especially for self-hosted or enterprise Jira instances.
        *   **Credential Configuration:** Carefully review the credential configuration in ELITEA, especially the authentication method selection and token/password fields for any hidden typographical errors or accidental whitespace.

If, after meticulously checking all of these points, you still encounter "Permission Denied" errors, please reach out to ELITEA Support with detailed information for further assistance.
