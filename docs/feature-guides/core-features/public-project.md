# Public Project Guide: Explore and Collaborate

The **Public project** in ELITEA serves as a collaborative hub where users can discover, utilize, and appreciate resources shared by the community. It's a space designed to foster knowledge sharing and accelerate innovation by making valuable prompts, agents, and datasources accessible to everyone within your organization.

**Key Features of the Public Project:**

*   **Shared Resources:** Access a curated collection of prompts, agents, and datasources contributed by other ELITEA users.
*   **Community Collaboration:** Benefit from the collective expertise and creativity of your colleagues.
*   **Discover Best Practices:** Explore highly-rated and trending resources to learn from successful implementations.
*   **Ready-to-Use Tools:** Execute published resources directly to leverage their functionality.
*   **Inspiration and Learning:** Discover new approaches and techniques by examining how others have built their resources.

**Accessing the Public Project:**

The **Public** project is readily accessible to all ELITEA users by default. You can switch to the Public project from your current project by clicking the Project switcher.

## Navigating the Public Project

The **Public** project is organized into distinct menus, each dedicated to a specific type of shared resource:

* **Chat**: Access to conversations, allowing to add participants (Agents, Prompts, Datasources, Models and Users) from Public project.
* **Prompts:** Discover and interact with prompts shared by the community.
* **Datasources:** Explore and utilize published datasources.
* **Agents:** Find and execute agents created and shared by other users.
* **Collections:** Browse and explore curated collections of resources.

Each of these menus (except Chat) shares a similar structure, making it easy to navigate and find what you're looking for.

## Exploring Shared Resources

Within each resource menu (Prompts, Datasources, Agents, Collections), you'll find three sub-sections designed to help you discover and engage with the shared content:

* **Latest:** This section displays the most recently published resources, giving you a glimpse into the newest additions to the community's shared pool.
* **My Likes:**  Here, you'll find a personalized list of the resources you've liked. This allows you to easily revisit your favorite and most valuable finds.
* **Trending:** This section showcases the most popular resources, ranked by the number of likes they've received. It's a great place to discover highly regarded and widely used resources within the community.

## Interacting with Published Resources

The **Public** project encourages active participation and appreciation of shared resources. Here's how you can interact with the prompts, datasources, and agents you find:

### Showing Appreciation: Liking Resources

If you find a published prompt, datasource, or agent particularly useful or well-crafted, you can show your appreciation by "liking" it.

* **To Like:** Click the **Heart** icon associated with the resource. The icon will typically change color or appearance to indicate that you've liked it.
* **To Unlike:** If you change your mind or no longer wish to like a resource, simply click the **Heart** icon again.

### Utilizing Published Resources

The primary purpose of the Public project is to allow users to leverage the shared resources.
You can directly execute published prompts and agents to utilize their functionality. Simply click on the resource's card or name to view its details and find the execution options.

**Important Note:** While you can view and execute resources in the Public project, **you cannot directly modify and save changes to the original published version.** These resources are intended for execution and inspiration.

### Incorporating Public Resources into Your Workflow

You can leverage valuable resources found in the Public project in several ways:

* **Adding to Collections:** Organize useful public prompts, datasources, or agents into your personal collections within your Private project for easy access and management.
* **Exporting Resources:** For backup or use in other platforms (if supported), you can export published prompts.

**Refer to the documentation for your Private project for detailed instructions on adding to collections and exporting resources.**

## Sharing Your Expertise: Publishing Resources

While you primarily interact with existing resources in the Public project, you can also contribute your own creations. If you've developed a valuable prompt, agent, or datasource in your **Private** project, you can submit it for publication to the **Public** project.

**The Publication Process:**

1. **Create and Refine:** Develop and thoroughly test your prompt, agent, or datasource in your **Private** project.
2. **Submit for Publication:**  Initiate the publication process for your resource. This typically involves clicking a "Publish" button within the resource's settings.
3. **Moderation Review:**  Resources submitted for publication are reviewed by designated moderators to ensure quality, relevance, and adherence to community guidelines.
4. **Approval and Publication:** If approved, your resource will be published and become available to the wider ELITEA community in the Public project.

**Note:** Only approved moderators have the ability to add resources to the Public project.

## Benefits of the Public Project

* **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoid recreating commonly used prompts, agents, or datasources by leveraging existing community contributions.
* **Accelerated Development:** Quickly find and utilize pre-built resources to speed up your workflows.
* **Enhanced Learning:** Discover new techniques and approaches by examining how others have designed their resources.
* **Community Building:** Contribute to a shared knowledge base and benefit from the collective expertise of your colleagues.

The ELITEA **Public** project is a valuable place for fostering collaboration and maximizing the potential of AI within your organization. Explore, engage, and contribute to make the most of this shared resource pool.
