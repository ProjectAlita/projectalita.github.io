## The Publication Process: Sharing Your Expertise

The Public Project thrives on community contributions. If you have created valuable Prompts or Collections in your **Private** or **Team** projects, you are encouraged to share them with the wider ELITEA community by publishing them to the Public Project.

### Publishing Prompts to the Public Project

To share your best Prompts with the community:

1.  **Create and Refine Prompt in Private/Team Project:** Develop and thoroughly test your Prompt in your **Private Workspace** or a **Team Project**. Ensure it is well-documented, high-quality, and provides valuable functionality.
2.  **Initiate Publication:** Open the **Prompts** menu in your **Private** project, locate the Prompt you want to share, and click the **"Publish"** icon associated with that Prompt.
3.  **Version Naming:** In the "Publish version" pop-up window, provide a descriptive **Version Name** for your Prompt (e.g., "Version 1.0 - Initial Release," "Version 1.1 - Improved Accuracy"). Click **"Publish"** to submit the Prompt for moderation.
4.  **Moderation Review:** Your submitted Prompt will undergo a review process by ELITEA moderators. Moderators will assess the Prompt for quality, relevance, clarity, and adherence to community guidelines.
5.  **Approval and Publication:** If your Prompt meets the moderation criteria, it will be **Approved** and published to the **Prompts menu within the Public Project**, making it accessible to all ELITEA users. You will receive a notification regarding the outcome of the moderation process.

**Important Notes on Prompt Publication:**

*   **Quality and Relevance:** Only high-quality, well-documented, and relevant Prompts are typically approved for publication to maintain the value and integrity of the Public Project resource pool.
*   **Moderator Feedback:** If your Prompt is **Rejected** during moderation, you will receive constructive feedback from the moderators, explaining the reasons for rejection and providing guidance on how to improve your Prompt for potential future submission.
*   **Version Control:** When publishing, you are publishing a specific **version** of your Prompt. This allows you to continue developing and improving your Prompts in your **Private** or **Team** projects without affecting the published version in the Public Project.

### Publishing Collections to the Public Project

To share curated sets of related Prompts (and potentially other Entities in the future) with the community:

1.  **Create and Curate Collection in Private/Team Project:** Create a well-organized and valuable Collection in your **Private Workspace** or a **Team Project**. Ensure it contains a set of thematically related and high-quality Entities (at least one published Prompt is required currently).
2.  **Initiate Collection Publication:** Open the **Collections** menu in your **Private** project, locate the Collection you want to share, and click the **"Publish collection" icon** within the Collection Detail View.
3.  **Moderation Review:** Your submitted Collection will undergo a review process by ELITEA moderators, similar to the Prompt publication process. Moderators will assess the Collection for relevance, organization, and overall value to the community.
4.  **Approval and Publication:** If your Collection meets the moderation criteria and contains at least one published Prompt, it will be **Approved** and published to the **Collections menu within the Public Project**, making it discoverable and accessible to all ELITEA users. You will be notified of the moderation outcome.

**Important Notes on Collection Publication:**

*   **Minimum Requirement - Published Entity:** A Collection must contain at least one *already published* Entity (currently, at least one published Prompt) to be eligible for publication.
*   **Separate Entity Publication:** Publishing a Collection does *not* automatically publish the individual Entities contained within it. Ensure that all Prompts (and other Entities you intend to share publicly within the Collection) are published *separately* before publishing the Collection.
*   **Collection Duplication:** Publishing a Collection creates a *duplicate* of your Collection in the Public Project. Changes made to your original Collection after publishing will not automatically update the published version.
*   **Focus on Prompts (Currently):** Currently, Collection publishing primarily focuses on sharing groups of Prompts. While Collections can contain Datasources and Agents, the publishing mechanism is primarily designed for sharing Prompts within Collections.

## Usage of Published Entities: Leveraging Community Resources

The primary purpose of the Public Project is to provide a readily accessible library of shared resources that you can leverage in your own ELITEA workflows. Here's how you can utilize published Prompts, Datasources, Agents, and Collections:

*   **Explore and Discover:** Browse the **Latest**, **My Likes**, and **Trending** sections within the Prompts, Datasources, Agents, and Collections menus in the Public Project to discover valuable resources shared by the community.
*   **Execute Published Prompts and Agents:** You can directly **execute** published Prompts and Agents from the Public Project to utilize their functionalities. Simply click on a Prompt or Agent card or name to open its detail view and access the "Run" tab to execute it.
*   **Inspiration and Learning:** Examine the configurations and designs of published Prompts, Datasources, and Agents to learn new techniques, discover different approaches to problem-solving, and gain inspiration for your own creations.
*   **Add Published Prompts to Collections (Private Project):**  You can add valuable Prompts you discover in the Public Project to your own **Collections** within your **Private Workspace** or **Team Projects**. This allows you to curate personalized collections of useful resources for your specific needs and workflows.
*   **Export Published Prompts (for Backup or External Use):** You can **export** published Prompts from the Public Project to create backups or utilize them in other compatible platforms (if supported by the export format).

**Important Limitations in Public Project:**

*   **Read-Only Access:** Remember that the Public Project is primarily a **read-only resource library.** You **cannot directly modify or save changes to the original published versions** of Prompts, Datasources, Agents, or Collections within the Public Project.
*   **No Direct Creation or Modification:** You cannot create new Entities or Collections directly within the Public Project. Creation and modification are done in your Private Workspace or Team Projects, and then resources are *published* to the Public Project.
